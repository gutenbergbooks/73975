<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p>This volume was originally designed to serve as a text and reference
book for the students attending the writer’s course on soils, given
annually at the University of California, who complained of their
inability to find in any connected treatise a large portion of
the subject matter brought before them. As all these students had
preliminary training in physics, chemistry and botany, no introductory
chapters on these general subjects were necessary or contemplated; the
more so as good elementary treatises embracing the needful preparation
are now numerous.</p>

<p>As time progressed, however, outside demands for a book embodying the
writer’s soil studies in the humid and arid regions, especially the
latter, became so numerous and pressing that the scope of the work has
gradually been much enlarged to conform to these demands; and this,
rather than completeness of detail, when such detail can be found well
given elsewhere, has been the guide in the necessary condensation of
the whole. To give the entire subject matter full elucidation, would
require several more volumes.</p>

<p>It may not be unnecessary to explain at the outset why and how this
treatise deviates in many respects from previous publications on the
same general topic. From boyhood up it has fallen to the writer’s lot
to be almost continuously in more or less direct contact with the
conditions and requirements of newly settled regions, as well as with
those hardly yet invaded even by the pioneer farmer; where the question
of cultural adaptation was yet undetermined or wholly in the dark.
Being during his active life constantly called upon in his official
capacity to give information and advice to pioneer farmers or intending
settlers in regard to the merits and adaptations of virgin soils, the
writer’s attention was naturally and forcibly directed toward soil
investigation as a possible means of determining, beforehand, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</span>
general prospects and special features of agriculture in regions where
actual experience was either non-existent or very brief and partial.
In the pursuit of these studies he has been favored by exceptional
opportunities, extending over a varied climatic area reaching on the
south from the Gulf of Mexico to the Ohio, across to the Pacific coast,
and to British Columbia on the north. That a systematic investigation
of soils over so large an area, covering both humid and arid regions,
should lead to some unexpected and novel results, is but natural; and
it is the discussion of these results in connection with those obtained
elsewhere, and with some of the prevailing views based thereon, that
must serve as the justification for the present addition to an already
well-stocked branch of literature.</p>

<p>From the very beginning of the scientific study of agriculture, the
investigation of soils with a view to the <i>à priori</i> determination
of their adaptation, permanent value, and best means of cultural
improvement, has formed the subject of continuous effort. It is not
easy to imagine a subject of higher direct importance to the physical
welfare of mankind, whose very existence depends on the yearly returns
drawn by cultural labor from the soil.</p>

<p>It is certainly remarkable that after all this long-continued effort,
even the fundamental principles, and still more the methods by which
the object in view is to be attained, are still so far in dispute that
a unification of opinion in this respect is not yet in view; and a
return to pure empiricism is from time to time brought forward to cut
the Gordian knot.</p>

<p>While this state of things is primarily due to the intrinsic complexity
and difficulty of the subject itself, it has unquestionably been
materially aggravated by accidental, partly historic conditions.
Foremost among these is the fact that until within recent times, soil
studies have borne almost entirely on lands long cultivated and in most
cases fertilized: thus changing them from their natural condition to a
more or less artificial one, which obscures the natural relations of
each soil to vegetation.</p>

<p>The importance of these relations is obvious, both from the theoretical
and from the practical standpoint. From the former, it is clear that
the native vegetation represents, within the climatic limits of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</span>
regional flora, the result of a secular process of adaptation of plants
to climates and soils, by natural selection and the survival of the
fittest. The natural floras and sylvas are thus the expression of
secular, or rather, millennial experience, which if rightly interpreted
must convey to the cultivator of the soil the same information that
otherwise he must acquire by long and costly personal experience.</p>

<p>The general correctness of this axiom is almost self-evident; it is
explicitly recognized in the universal practice of settlers in new
regions, of selecting lands in accordance with the character of the
forest growth thereon; it is even legally recognized by the valuation
of lands upon the same basis, for purposes of assessment, as is
practiced in a number of States.</p>

<p>The accuracy with which experienced farmers judge of the quality of
timbered lands by their forest growth, has justly excited the wonder
and envy of agricultural investigators, whose researches, based upon
incomplete theoretical assumptions, failed to convey to them any such
practical insight. It was doubtless this state of the case that led a
distinguished writer on agriculture to remark, nearly half a century
ago, that he “would rather trust an old farmer for his judgment of land
than the best chemist alive.”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>It is certainly true that mere physico-chemical analyses, unassisted
by other data, will frequently lead to a wholly erroneous estimate of
a soil’s agricultural value, when applied to cultivated lands. But
the matter assumes a very different aspect when, with the natural
vegetation and the corresponding cultural experience as guides, we seek
for the factors upon which the observed natural selection of plants
depends, by the physical and chemical examination of the respective
soils. It is further obvious that, these factors being once known, we
shall be justified in applying them to those cases in which the guiding
mark of native vegetation is absent, as the result of causes that have
not materially altered the natural condition of the soil.</p>

<p>It is probable that, had agricultural science been first developed in
regions where the external conditions permitted the carrying-out of
such a course of investigation, instead of in the abnormally temperate,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</span>
even and humid climate of middle Europe, with its long-cropped, worn
fields, and very predominantly calcareous soils, the present condition
of this science might differ not immaterially from that actually
existing. As a matter of fact, it has attained its present state under
very disadvantageous external conditions, which frequently necessitated
a recourse to highly complex and laborious methods and artificial
appliances, for the establishment and maintenance of the conditions
which elsewhere might have been found abundantly realized in nature;
thus permitting, by the multiplication of observations over extended
and widely varied areas, the elimination and control of accidental
errors of experiment and observation.</p>

<p>Just as in historical geology the subdivisions of formations observed
and accepted in Europe formed for many years a procrustean bed upon
which the facts observed elsewhere had to be stretched, so in the
domain of soil physics and chemistry, and even in vegetable physiology,
the observations made in the really exceptional climates and soils
of middle Western Europe, have often erroneously been construed as
constituting a general basis for unalterable deductions.</p>

<p>The rapid extension of civilization and the carrying of minute
scientific research into other regions, now rendered possible by the
improved means of communication, has shown the one-sidedness of some of
the views prevailing heretofore, inasmuch as they are really applicable
only to accidental and rather exceptional conditions.</p>

<p>It is therefore one object of this volume to present and discuss
summarily the facts of physical and chemical soil constitution and
functions with reference to the additional light afforded on the wider
basis, embracing both the humid and the arid regions; of which the
latter has, as such, received but scant and desultory attention thus
far, to the detriment of both the work of the agricultural experiment
stations and of agricultural practice. The book therefore includes the
discussion both of the methods and results of direct physical, chemical
and botanical soil investigation, as well as the subject matter
relating to the origin, formation, classification and physical as well
as chemical nature of soil, usually included in works on scientific
agriculture.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</span></p>

<p>In the presentation of these subjects, it has been the writer’s aim
to reach both the students in his own classes and in the agricultural
colleges generally, as well as the fast increasing class of farmers of
both regions who are willing and even anxious to avail themselves of
the results and principles of scientific investigation, without “shying
off” from the new or unfamiliar words necessary to embody new ideas. It
would seem to be time that the latter class, and more especially those
constituting farmers’ clubs, should learn to understand and appreciate
both the terms and methods of scientific reasoning, which are likely to
form, increasingly, the subjects of instruction in the public schools.
But in order to segregate to some extent the generally intelligible
matter from that which requires more scientific preparation than can
now be generally expected, it has been thought best to use in the text
two kinds of type; the larger one embodying the matter presumed to be
interesting and intelligible to the general reader, while the smaller
type carries the illustrative detail and discussion which will be
sought chiefly by the student.</p>

<p>As regards the chemical nomenclature used in this volume, the writer
has not thought it advisable to follow the example set by some late
authors in substituting for the well-known names of the bases and
acids, those of the elements, and still less, those of the intangible
ions. Any one who has taught classes in agricultural chemistry will
have experienced the difficulty and loss of time unnecessarily incurred
in the incessantly recurring transposition of terms, and complication
of formulæ, serving no useful purpose save that of academic
consistency. It is of at least doubtful utility to present to the
farmer, <i>e. g.</i>, the inflammable and dangerous elements phosphorus
and potassium as prime factors in the success of his crops, and of
healthy nutrition.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as all the elements are presented to and contained in the
plant in compounds only, and these compounds are themselves, in the
dilute solutions used by plants, known to be largely dissociated into
their basic and acid groups, it seems to be most natural to present
them under the corresponding, even if not absolutely theoretically
correct names of acids and bases, to which the farmer and the trade
have been accustomed for half a century. Upon these considerations the
long-used designations of potash, soda, lime, phosphoric, sulfuric,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</span>
nitric and other acids and bases have been retained in this volume,
adding the chemical formula where, as in analytical statements, a doubt
as to their meaning might arise. Assuredly, the diffusion of scientific
knowledge should not be needlessly hindered by the adoption of a
pedantic mode of presentation.</p>

<p>The great breadth of the subject of this volume has rendered
inadvisable any extended bibliography, such as it has of late become
customary to add to works of this kind. References have therefore been
restricted to publications specially discussed, and to such as are not
widely known on account of limited circulation.</p>

<p>The author’s warmest acknowledgments are due to Professor R. H.
Loughridge, of the University of California, for efficient and
sympathetic assistance, both in the revision of the manuscript, and
active personal help in the preparation of the illustrations. Without
his coöperation the preparation and publication of the volume would
have been much longer delayed.</p>

<p>Acknowledgments are also due for helpful suggestions and criticism
to Professors L. H. Bailey, of Cornell University, F. H. King, of
Wisconsin, and Jacques Loeb of the University of California.</p>

<p><i>Definition of Soils.</i>—In the most general meaning of the term, a
soil is the more or less loose and friable material in which, by means
of their roots, plants may or do find a foothold and nourishment, as
well as other conditions of growth. Soils form the uppermost layer of
the earth’s crust; but the term does not indicate any such definite
average texture as is sometimes implied by its popular use to designate
certain loose, loamy materials found in older geological formations. We
do find in these, not unfrequently, layers that in the past have served
to support vegetation, as evidenced by remains of plants found therein.
But as a rule, such ancient soils are much compacted and otherwise
changed, and would not now be capable of performing the office of
plant nutrition without previous, long-continued exposure to the same
agencies by which all soils were originally formed from pre-existing
rocks. Within the latter category must be included, in scientific
parlance, not only the hard rocks known as such in daily life, but also
such soft materials as clay, sand, marls, etc., which often compose,
partially or wholly, the bodies of wide-spread geological formations.</p>

<p><i>Elements Constituting the Earth’s Crust.</i>—More than seventy
elementary substances have been found within the portion of the earth
accessible to man; most of these are present only in very minute
proportions; of those occurring in relatively considerable quantities,
a list showing their approximate proportions is given below.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxiv">[Pg xxiv]</span>
<i>Average quantitative composition of the Earth’s Crust.</i>—The
total thickness of the outer shell of the earth, thus far known to
us, does not exceed about 95,000 feet, as observed in the accessible
rock deposits. Estimates of the proportions in which the more abundant
elements contribute to the composition of these constituent rocks, have
repeatedly been made. The latest and most widely accepted of these, by
F. W. Clarke, of the U. S. Geological Survey, is given herewith. It
includes the constituents of the sea and atmosphere as well; these two
constitute about 7 per cent of the whole, 93 per cent being solid rocks.</p>

<p>It will be noted that one-half of the total consists of oxygen, and
that nearly 86% (or 47.29% of the 49.98%) of this amount is contained
in the solid rocks; nearly 2.50% of the remainder in sea and other
water; and .41% in the atmosphere, in the free condition, in which it
serves for the respiration of animals and plants, and for the various
processes of slow and rapid combustion, or “oxidation.” This relatively
small proportion of the whole, is, nevertheless, the most directly
important for the maintenance of organic life.</p>

<p><i>Oxids Constitute Earth’s Crust.</i>—The vast predominance of oxygen
in the above list suggests at once that most of the other elements
must exist in combination with it, <i>i. e.</i>, as “oxids.” H. S.
Washington<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
has lately revised the estimates heretofore made, on the basis of a
very large number of analyses made by him and others, of rocks within
the United States, and gives the following table; alongside of which
is placed a revised estimate by Clarke, which also includes rocks from
abroad; both being given in terms of oxids of the several elements.

<p>The salient point which at once attracts attention in these tables is
the great predominance of the oxid of silicon—silica, silicic acid,
quartz, etc.,—over all other substances. While quartz occurs alone
in enormous masses, as will be shown later, probably the greater
proportion is found in combination with other oxids, notably those of
aluminum, calcium, iron, magnesium, and the alkali metals potassium and
sodium. Chlorin and fluorin, however, do not occur as oxids.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p><i>The Chemical Elements Important to Agriculture.</i>—Of the numerous
elements known to chemists, only eighteen require mention in connection
with either soil formation or plant growth; and of these only thirteen
or fourteen participate in normal plant growth. They are the following:</p>

Of this list, titanium, though a very constant ingredient of soils in
the form of titanic dioxid, is not known as performing any important
function in soils, and is not, so far as known at present, ever taken
up by plants. Aluminum, in the form of its compounds with oxygen
and silicon, is a very prominent and physically very important soil
ingredient, but does not, apparently, perform any direct function in
plant nutrition, and is absent from their ash, except in the case of
some of the lower plants (horsetails and ferns).</p>

<p>Iodin appears to be normally present in all seaweeds, and occurs in
traces in some land plants. Fluorin is a normal ingredient of animal
bones, and its presence in plant ashes is often easily shown. The
remaining fourteen, however, are always present in plants; carbon,
hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen forming the volatile or combustible part,
while the rest occur in the ashes.</p>

<p>It is true that other elements, or rather their compounds, are
sometimes found in plants, being taken up by them from solutions
existing in the soil. Thus the alkalies caesium and rubidium, also
barium, strontium, zinc, copper, boron and some others, may be absorbed
when present in soluble form. But they are neither necessary nor
beneficial to plant economy, and when in considerable amounts are
harmful. Thus fifteen elements, ommiting iodin and titanium, alone
require discussion.</p>

<p><i>The Volatile Part of Plants</i>, as already stated, consists of
carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen. Of these, carbon is obtained
by the plant exclusively from the carbonic (dioxid) gas of the air;
hydrogen and oxygen, from the soil in the form of water; nitrogen,
directly from the soil but indirectly also from the air, through the
agency of certain bacteria. The <i>ash ingredients</i> of course are
all derived from the soil through the roots, and must all be present in
the latter in an available form, to a sufficient extent to supply the
demands of vegetation.</p>

<p><i>The Agencies of Soil Formation.</i>—With respect to their mode of
formation, soils may be defined as the residual product of the physical
disintegration and chemical decomposition of rocks; with, ordinarily,
a small proportion of the remnants of organic life. The agencies
producing these changes are those classed under the general term
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxvii">[Pg xxvii]</span>
“atmospheric” or “meteorological;” they include therefore the action of
<i>temperature</i>—heat and cold—that of <i>water</i>, and that of
<i>air and its ingredients</i>. In popular parlance, it includes the
processes of <i>weathering</i>; nearly the same processes are involved
in the “fallowing” of soils.</p>

<span class="h_subtitle">THE PHYSICAL PROCESSES OF SOIL FORMATION.</span></h3>
</div>

<p>Since the physical and mechanical effects of the agencies mentioned
above usually precede, in time, the chemical changes, which are
materially facilitated by the previous pulverization of the rocks, the
former should be first considered.</p>

<p><i>Effects of heat and cold on rocks.</i>—Most rocks are aggregates
of several simple minerals; a few only (limestone, quartzite and a few
others) expand or contract alike in all their parts. Of the minerals
composing the compound rocks, scarcely any expand to exactly the same
extent under the influence of the sun’s heat, especially when their
colors differ; nor, in the great majority of cases, does one and the
same mineral expand alike in all three directions. It follows that at
each change of temperature there is a tendency to the formation of
minute fissures between adjacent crystals or masses of different simple
minerals; and especially in the case of large crystals of certain
kinds, this action alone will gradually result in the disruption of the
rock surface, so that individual crystals may be detached with little
difficulty. In any case, the cracks so formed are gradually widened
by a frequent repetition of the changes of temperature, coupled with
access of air, water, dust, and the rootlets of plants; all of which
brings about a gradually increasing rate of surface crumbling. This is
especially conspicuous at the higher elevations of mountains, where the
temperature changes are very great and abrupt; and also in the clear
atmosphere of deserts, where owing to the extent and suddenness of
temperature-changes between day and night, caused by the free radiation
of heat into the clear sky, even homogeneous pebbles are known to be
almost explosively disrupted in the mornings and evenings of clear days.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span></p>

<p>Such effects may often be strikingly observed on small surfaces of
compound crystalline rocks, such as granite, exposed on glaciers, where
the daily changes of temperature are often extreme, viz., from below
the freezing point to as much as 130 degrees Fahr. (54.4 degrees C). In
such cases one may sometimes scoop off the disintegrated rock by the
handful, while yet the mineral surfaces are almost perfectly fresh.</p>

<p>On a larger scale, the disruption and scaling off of huge slabs of
granite, and rocks of similar structure, may be observed in southern
California on the southwestern side of rock exposures, where slabs
from a few inches to ten and more feet in length and eight or ten
inches thick, have slid off, perhaps still leaning against the parent
rock, which has been rounded off by a succession of such events into
the domelike form so characteristic of granite mountains. Merrill<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
reports similar exfoliations to occur especially on the peninsula of
California, on Stone Mountain in Georgia, and elsewhere.</p>

<p>A striking exemplification of the effects of frequent and rapid changes
of temperature on rocks, and of humid and dry climates as well, is seen
in the case of the great monoliths of Egypt, one of which now stands in
the Central Park, New York. In the quarries of Syene in Upper Egypt,
where most of these monoliths were obtained, the rough blocks that
were in progress of quarrying when the work was abandoned, quite two
thousand years ago, still show an almost perfectly fresh surface; and
the same is true of the finished obelisks in Lower Egypt, where both
the changes of temperature and the rainfall are somewhat greater. It
is a matter of public note that one of “Cleopatra’s Needles” which was
set up in Central Park nearly thirty years ago, but originally erected
at Heliopolis on the Nile, is in great danger of destruction from the
influence of a totally different climate, in which both the temperature
changes and the rainfall are much more frequent and severe than in
Egypt. The large crystals of feldspar and quartz which compose the
(syenite) rock material have had fine fissures formed between them by
often-repeated expansion and contraction; which when filled with water
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
and subsequently changed to ice, the latter’s expansion in freezing
(see below) has still farther enlarged them and caused a scaling-off,
which threatens to obliterate the hieroglyphic inscriptions. Thus
temperature-changes and a rain followed by freezing may in a few days
produce a greater effect than a thousand years of Egyptian climate.</p>

<p><i>Cleavage of rocks.</i>—Many kinds of rocks have definite directions
of ready cleavage. The most common and obvious cases of this kind
are schists, slates and shales, cleaving readily into plates or
irregular flat or lens-shaped fragments. Such structure greatly favors
disintegration, especially when the layers are on edge at steep
angles. But there are other apparently structureless, massive rocks,
particularly basalts and other eruptive rocks related to them, as well
as many sandstones and claystones, that have a strong tendency to
cleave into more or less definite forms when struck; such as columns
or prisms, square, six-sided or diamond-shaped blocks, etc. Similar
forms are naturally produced in them under the influence of changes
of temperature; by the formation of minute cracks at first, then
enlargement of these by the several agencies already mentioned.</p>

<p><i>Effects of freezing water.</i>—The irresistible force exerted by
the expansion of water in freezing, amounting to about 9 per cent of
its bulk, is a powerful factor in widening and deepening fissures and
cracks of rocks; not uncommonly, whole masses of rock are rent into
fragments by this agency, which is one of the most common causes of
“rock falls” on the brink of precipices. By the freezing process cracks
and crevices are enlarged, and the surfaces exposed to weathering are
still farther increased; and the rock fragments or soil particles are
loosened and rendered more liable to be removed from the original site,
whether by gravity, wind or water.</p>

<p><i>Glaciers.</i>—Ice in the form of the glaciers that descend from
mountain chains (<a href="#FIG_1">see figure 1</a>), and of the moving ice sheets
that have covered large portions of North America and Europe in past ages and now
cover Greenland and the South Polar continent, exerts a most potent
action in abrading and grinding even the hardest rocks; not so much
by the direct friction of the moving ice itself, as by the cutting,
scoring, grinding and crushing action which the stones imbedded in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
ice, or carried and shoved by it, exert upon the rocky channels in
which the ice stream moves, as well as upon each other. The product of
this grinding process is largely very fine (hence “glacier flour”),
so that it remains suspended in the water of the glacier-streams
until their velocity is permanently checked when reaching a plain
or lake. This suspended stone-flour imparts to the glacier streams
their distinctive character of “white rivers,” as contradistinguished
from the clear, dark “green rivers” that have their origin outside of
glaciated areas. This difference can be readily observed in traveling
along any of the glacier-bearing mountain chains of the world, and is
frequently expressed in the names of the streams.</p>

<p>It will be noted that over 70 per cent of this mud consists of
extremely fine, wholly impalpable materials; but little of which is
true clay.</p>

<p>The fineness of the glacier flour renders it peculiarly suitable for
the rapid conversion into soil, and such soils are usually excellent
and remarkably durable. The great and lasting fertility of the soils
of southern Sweden is traced directly to this mode of origin, and
doubtless the great American ice sheet of glacier times is similarly
concerned in the high quality of the soil of our “north central”
states, from the Ohio to the Great Lakes and the Missouri.</p>

<p>The accumulations of rocks and debris of all sizes in the “moraines”
or detrital deposits of glaciers and ice-sheets form another class of
glacier-made lands which cover extensive and important agricultural
areas (drift areas), both in the old and new worlds. Such lands are
undulating or slightly hilly, and the soil usually contains imbedded
in it stones of a great variety of kinds and sizes, partly angular,
partly rounded and polished by friction. Of course the frequent and
violent changes of temperature occurring on the surface of a glacier,
aid materially in reducing the rocks carried by it to the condition in
which we find the material of the moraines; which commonly form lateral
or cross ridges in valleys formerly occupied by glaciers.</p>

<p><i>Action of flowing water.</i>—The action of flowing water is
doubtless at this time the most potent mechanical agency of soil
formation. From the sculpturing of the original simple forms in which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
geological agencies left the earth’s surface into the complex ones
of modern mountain chains, to the formation of valleys, plains,
and basins out of the materials so carried away, its effects are
prodigious. The torrents and streams in carrying silt, sand, gravel
and bowlders, according to velocity and volume, do not merely displace
these materials; the rock fragments of all sizes not only score and
abrade the bed of the rill or stream, but by their mutual attrition
produce more or less of fine powder similar to that formed by glacier
action; usually more mixed in its ingredients than the former, because
derived from a wider range of drainage surface. In the glacier stream
itself, it is easy to trace the gradual transition from the sharp stone
fragments lying in the water as it issues from the terminal ice cave at the
lower end of the glacier, to the rounded shingle found a few miles below.</p>

    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.</span>—Erosion of
        Hawaiian Hills, near Honolulu. (Phot. by H. C. Myers.)</p>
</div>

<p>On slopes where water flows only during rain or the melting of
snow, the same erosive effects may be seen as between the heads of
ravines and their outlets. (<a href="#FIG_2">See figure 2</a>,) It is there
too that the surprisingly rapid cutting-out of channels by the aid of water
charged with rock fragments or gravel, can readily be observed, and
the enormous power of water erosion convincingly shown. In the United
States the stupendous gorges of the Columbia and Colorado rivers, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
former cut to a depth of over 2000 feet into hard basalt rock, the
latter to over 5,000 feet, partly into softer materials, partly into
granite, are perhaps the most striking examples of this power; the
manifestations of which can, however, be as convincingly seen in
thousands of minor rivers and streams.</p>

<p>All the materials so carried off from the higher slopes are finally
deposited on a lower level; whether only a short distance away on a
lower slope (colluvial soils), or farther away in the flood plain of
streams, rivers, or lakes (alluvial soils). Other things being equal,
the finest materials are of course, carried farthest, and often into
the sea; in which, however, they cannot long remain suspended, but are
quickly thrown down, forming river bars, flood plains, and deltas. The
fineness of the material of delta soils, like that of those made from
glacier flour, insures them the same advantage, viz. great fertility
and durability.</p>

<p>It is calculated that the Mississippi River carries into the Gulf of
Mexico annually some 7469 millions of cubic feet of earthy deposits,
which would fill one square mile of surface to the height of 268 feet,
or would cover that number of square miles to the depth of one foot.</p>

    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.</span>—Cliffs and caves
       on sea-beach at La Jolla, Calif. showing effects of Wave action.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Wave-Action.</i>—The powerful effects of the beating of waves upon
abrupt shores of seas or lakes are in evidence all over the world, and
these effects are so characteristic that they can be recognized even
where no sea or lake exists at present. Gravel and sand are carried
in the surf and serve as grinding materials, wearing even the hardest
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
rocks into grooves, rills, channels and caves, defining sharply the
varying degrees of hardness or tough resistance in different parts
of rocky cliffs; frequently undermining them and causing extensive
rock falls. The latter then serve for a time to break the violence of
the waves’ onset, and may even cause permanent shore deposits to be
formed under their lee.</p>

<p>Such deposits are very generally formed on gently sloping beaches,
and as the water gradually recedes, sometimes by elevation of the
ground, beach lines or beach-terraces are left, which indicate the
successive levels of the lake or sea. Such old beach lines or terraces
and level-surfaced “buttes” in the Great Basin country, and “bench
lands” elsewhere, show in their structure the characteristic lines of
wave-deposition.</p>

<p><i>Effects of Winds.</i>—The action of winds in transporting soil
particles (dust and sand) is familiar; and the accumulations that
may be formed under the influence of regular, continuous winds are
sufficiently obvious on lee shores having sandy beaches, inland of
which the formation of sand dunes at times assumes a threatening
magnitude. Where winds are irregular, frequently reversing their
direction, of course the local effects will be less obvious, and
the transportation of material actually occurring will often not be
noticed. Yet there can be no doubt of the importance of wind action
in soil formation, and there are cases in which no other agency
can explain the facts observed over widely extended areas. This is
especially true with regard to the soil masses of the high plains
or plateaus of the dry continental interiors, where not only the
regularity of the prevailing winds, but also the structure (or absence
of structure) and pulverulent character of the soil itself, renders
this the only rational mode of accounting for its presence where we
find it.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">The effects that may be exerted by regular winds
are well illustrated in the plains and deserts of Africa as well as
those of central Asia. Here we find a distinct subdivision of the
desert (rainless) areas into the <i>stony</i>, from which the wind has
swept all but the bedrock and gravel and where scarcely any natural
growth, and certainly no cultivation is possible in the almost total
absence of soil. The next subdivision is the <i>sandy</i> desert, to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
leeward of the stony area, where the winds are less violent and
regular, and where, therefore, the sand has been dropped and is waited
back and forth by “sand storms,” the surface being covered with moving
sand dunes. Still farther to leeward we find the region in which the
finer portions of the desert surface has been deposited; here we have
“<i>dust</i> storms” so long as the land is not irrigated: but the
application of water renders the soil abundantly fruitful. Such is the
case of the Oases and fertile border-lands of the Sahara and Libyan deserts.</p>

<p>In the cultivated portions of the Mojave and Colorado deserts in
California, plowing of the land during a dry time is not uncommonly
followed by a bodily removal of the loosened soil to neighboring
fields, sometimes leaving a gravel surface behind. Such “blown-out
lands” exist naturally at numerous points in the Colorado desert.</p>

<p>Sven Hedin (Central Asia and Tibet, Vol. II.) shows that from the
effects of the violent storms that prevail in the Gobi or Takla Makan
desert, Lop-nor lake, the sink of the Tarim river, has in the course
of time shifted its bed as much as fifty miles in consequence of the
excavation of the southern part of the desert by the wind; while the
sand so blown out, together with the deposits from the rivers, now
tends to fill up the present (southern) lake, which is gradually
returning northward toward its original site, now a desert, but around
which formerly a dense population existed.</p>

<p>The great plains of North America, the pampas of South America, the
plateaus of Mongolia and especially the fertile loess region of
northwestern China, are also cases in point. The dense dust storms of
these regions are familiar and unpleasant phenomena, which are often
observed even by vessels at sea off the east coast of South America,
where the dust-laden “pamperos” at times compel them to proceed with
the same precautions as in a fog; and the same is true of the northeast
winds blowing off the Sahara desert on the west coast of Africa.</p>

<p>The effects of windstorms carrying sand in the <i>erosion of rocks</i>
are very obvious and striking in many parts of the world; nowhere
probably as much so as on the great plains of western North America,
where the geological composition of the “bad lands” is frequently
impressed upon the rock surfaces very prominently. The strikingly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
grotesque forms are frequently brought out in this way, especially
in the case of “mushroom” rocks, where a hard stratum has remained
as a covering while softer layers underneath have been worn away.
The illustration annexed shows such a case on the plains of Wyoming
as figured in the Report of the U. S. Geological Survey, on the
Central Great Plains, by N. H. Darton. Striking examples of the same
effects are seen on the shores of Lake Michigan in the Grand Traverse
region, where the rocky cliffs are visibly worn away and carved under
the influence of the regular “sand-blasts” of northwest winds. On a
smaller scale the effects of these sand-blasts may be noted in the
cobble-deserts, where we frequently find the cobbles worn away on the
windward side in a very characteristic manner; the lee side remaining
rounded and smooth, while the structure of the rock is strongly
outlined on the windward side.</p>

<h4>CLASSIFICATION OF SOILS.</h4>

<p><i>The physical Constituents</i> of soils are thus, in the most general
terms, first, <i>rock powder</i> (“sand”) more or less changed by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
weathering; second, <i>clay</i>, as one of the chief results of the
weathering process of silicate minerals; and thirdly, <i>humus</i>,
the dark-colored remnant of vegetable decay. According to the obvious
predominance of one or the other of these primary ingredients, soils
are popularly, in the most general sense, classed as “heavy” and
“light”; the former term corresponding as a rule to those in which
clay forms a prominent ingredient, while sandy and humous or “mold”
soils usually fall under the latter designation, because of their easy
tillage. For practical purposes these subdivisions are both convenient
and important, and they form the ordinary basis of land classification.
Beyond these, the degree of fineness of the rock debris, and their
physical and chemical constitution, determine distinctions such as
gravelly, sandy, silty, loamy, calcareous, siliceous, magnesian,
ferruginous, and others of less general application, though locally
often of considerable importance.</p>

<p>For the purposes of discussion and definition, however, another basis
of classification is needed, which essentially concerns both the origin
and the adaptations of lands.</p>

    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 5.</span>—Diagram illustrating
     the genetic relation of different soil classes to each other.</p>
</div>

<p>1. <i>Sedentary Soils.</i>—When soils have been formed without removal
from the site of the original rock, by simple weathering, they are
designated as <i>sedentary</i>, or <i>residual</i> soils, or “soils
in place.” In the case of these, the original rock underlies the soil
or subsoil at a greater or less depth, according to the intensity
and duration of the weathering process, and is usually more or less
softened and decomposed at the surface where it meets the soil layer.
The latter of course bears some of the distinctive characters of the
parent rock, and its composition and adaptations may, in a measure,
be directly inferred from that origin. Such soils usually contain,
especially in their lower portions, some angular fragments of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
parent rock. In some cases sedentary soils may have been partially
derived from rocks that have been removed from above the present
country rock by erosion, and in that case fragments of such vanished
rock may also be present.</p>

<p>Sedentary soils are most commonly found on rock plateaus and on slopes
or plains underlaid by rock strata of but slight inclination, where the
velocity of the “runoff” rainfall is not sufficient to dislodge the
rock debris. Extended areas of such soils exist in the granitic areas
of the southern Alleghenies, in the “black prairies” of the Cotton
States, and on the “basaltic” plateaus of the Pacific Northwest.</p>

<p>2. <i>Colluvial Soils.</i>—When the soil mass formed by weathering has
been removed from the original site to such a degree as to cause it to
intermingle with the materials of other rocks or layers, as is usually
the case on hillsides, and in undulating uplands generally, as the
result of rolling or sliding down, washing of rains, sweeping of wind,
etc., the mixed soil, which will usually be found to contain angular
fragments of various rocks, and is destitute of any definite structure,
is designated as a <i>colluvial</i><a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
one. Colluvial soil masses are frequently subject to disturbance
from landslides, which are usually the result of water penetrating
underneath, between the soil mass and the underlying rock, or sometimes
simply of complete saturation of the former with water. Aside from such
catastrophic action, they commonly have a slow downward movement in
mass (creep), which ordinarily becomes perceptible only in the course
of years; most quickly where there are heavy frosts in winter, which
act both by direct expansion, and by the state of extreme looseness in
which the soil mass is left on thawing. Colluvial soils form a large
portion of rolling and hilly uplands, and are of very varying degrees
of productiveness.</p>

<p>3. <i>Alluvial Soils.</i>—When soils are the result of deposition by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
streams, the material having been gathered along the course of the
stream from various sources and carried to a distance before being
deposited, the soil is designated as <i>alluvial</i>. These are the
soils of the valleys, flood-plains, and sea- and lake-borders, past
and present. Being of mixed origin, their general character may vary
from one extreme to the other, both as regards physical and chemical
composition. Since, moreover, they represent the finer portions
of the soils of the regions drained by the water-courses, alluvial
soils are as a rule of a fine texture; and as representing the most
advanced decomposition products of the parent rocks, they are usually
preëminently fertile. This is proverbially true of the flood-plains of
rivers, and still more of their deltas—the bodies of lands formed near
their outlets into seas or lakes.</p>

<p><i>Character of these soil-classes.</i>—<i>Sedentary</i> soils are as
a matter of course, other things being equal, dependent entirely on the
parent rock for their specific character; and taking into consideration
the various rocks (usually one or few) from which they may have been
derived, nearly the same is true of <i>colluvial</i> soils, except that
a portion of the clay and finest pulverulent matters may in their case
be carried down on the lower slopes and into the valleys and streams,
by the hillside rills.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">According to the calculation of Merrill
(<i>Rocks, Rock-weathering, and Soils</i>, p. 188) granite when
transformed into soil <i>without loss</i> would increase in weight by
88%; more than doubling its bulk. More usually, the leaching process
<i>diminishes</i> their volume as compared with the parent rock.</p>

<p><i>Alluvial</i> soils are also of course to a certain extent dependent
upon the character of the rocks and surface deposits occurring within
the drainage area of the depositing stream. As a rule their composition
is much more generalized; but their character as to the relative
proportions of sand and clay is essentially dependent upon the velocity
of the water current. Thus in the upper portions of valleys, where the
slope is relatively steep and the velocity therefore high, a large
proportion of cobbles and gravel is often present in the deposits,
sometimes to the extent of rendering cultivation impracticable, or at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
least unprofitable. As the slope and velocity decrease, first coarse
and then fine sand will be the prominent component of the deposited
soil; while still lower down, in the region of slack water, the
finest sand or silt, together with clay, will predominate. According
to Hopkins,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
flowing water will, at a velocity of three inches per second,
<i>carry</i> in suspension only fine clay (and silt); at eight inches
it will carry sand as large as linseed. At one and one-third inches, it
will <i>move</i> pebbles one inch in diameter; and at a velocity of two
inches per second, pebbles of egg size are moved along the stream bed.
Since the velocity of streams subject to freshets will vary greatly
from time to time, deposits of very different grain will in such cases
be found alternating with one another in the soil stratum of the flood
plain. In fact, this alternation and the more or less stratified
structure resulting therefrom, is the distinguishing mark of alluvial
soils as such. It is true that this peculiarity is also sometimes found
in the case of lands now lying far above the flood-plains of present
rivers; but this is due to the elevation of the land or the depression
of the river channels at a former period, prior to which such lands
(commonly known as river terraces, benches or second bottoms) were
formed. The same is true of lake terraces (“mesas”), which cover
enormous areas in some parts of the world, more particularly in
western North America. It must nevertheless be remembered that such
alluvial terrace or bench soils differ in some respects from the modern
alluvials, on account of their long exposure to atmospheric action
alone; one result of which is that they are usually much poorer in
humus, and therefore of lighter tints, than the more modern soils of
alluvial origin. Other differences will be adverted to hereafter.</p>

<p>As a matter of course the above distinctions, especially between
colluvial and alluvial soils, cannot be rigorously maintained in all
cases. There are transitions from one class to the other, so that it
is sometimes optional with the observer to which of the two classes a
particular soil may be considered as belonging. On the lower slopes of
the hills bordering alluvial valleys the colluvial slope-soil may often
be found alternating with the alluvial deposits, or bodily washed away
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
to be redeposited as alluvium at a greater or less distance.</p>

<p>One characteristic of the flood-plain lands of all the larger rivers,
and more or less of all streams subject to periodic overflows, is that
the land immediately adjoining the banks is both higher and more sandy
than are the lands farther back from the stream. The cause of this
phenomenon is that as lateral overflow diminishes the velocity of that
flow, its coarser portions are deposited near the river banks, while
the finer particles are carried farther away, until finally only the
finest—clay-substance—reach the lagoons or lakes filled with the
overflow or backwater, and are there in the course of time deposited
as heavy clay “swamp” soils. The same occurs where rivers empty into
lakes or the sea; and these slack-water or delta lands are, as a rule,
the most productive on the river’s course. The continued productiveness
of alluvial soils is moreover in many cases assured by the deposition,
during overflows, of fresh soil-material brought down from the head
waters of the streams. The Nile, and the Colorado river of the West,
illustrate this point.</p>

<p><i>Lowering of the land-surface by soil formation.</i>—It is evident
that the soil-forming agencies must in the course of time materially
affect both the surface conformation and the absolute level of the
land. The sharp pinnacles and crests of rock are abraded into the
rounded forms now characterizing our uplands and lower ranges of hills
and mountains; and it is estimated that, <i>e. g.</i>, the general
level of the drainage basin of the Mississippi river is lowered about
one foot in 7,000 years, the material being carried into the lowlands
and the sea.</p>

<h4><i>Chemical Disintegration, or Decomposition.</i></h4>

<p>It may be said that in general, the physical agencies of disintegration
are most intensely active in the dry or arid regions of the globe,
while chemical processes of decomposition are most active in humid
climates.</p>

<p>The chemical decomposition of rocks is primarily due to the action of the
atmosphere, the average composition of which may be stated as follows:</p>

<p>In addition to the above, air contains minute amounts of the very
indifferent and therefore practically negligible elements, argon,
krypton, neon, xenon and helium, the aggregate amount of which in air
is somewhat less than one per cent, of which the greater part is argon.
So far as known these elements take no part whatever in vegetable or
animal life, and possess no known chemical action or affinity.</p>

<p>The primary active agents in effecting chemical changes in rocks by
which soils are formed, are water, carbonic acid,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
and oxygen; all therefore ingredients of the atmosphere. Hence the
chemical changes so brought about are in the most general sense
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
comprehended within the term weathering, as applied to rocks; while the
corresponding but more complex action within the soil itself is usually
termed fallowing.</p>

<p><i>Effects of Water.</i>—Since but few substances, particularly among
those forming rocks, are totally insoluble even in pure water,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
and some (such as gypsum) may be considered easily soluble in the same,
the rain water must exert solvent action wherever it penetrates.
In nature, however, strictly pure water does not occur, it being
difficult to obtain it even artificially. Among the “impurities” almost
always contained in natural water, there are several that materially
increase its solvent power. Foremost among these, both because almost
universally present and on account of its great ultimate efficacy,
is <i>Carbonic dioxid</i>, in contact with water forming <i>carbonic
acid</i>, the acidulous ingredient of all effervescent waters, the gas
which is produced in nature by innumerable processes, such as decay,
putrefaction, fermentation, the slow or rapid combustion of vegetable
and animal substances, such as wood, charcoal and all other fuels; by
the respiration of animals; in the burning of limestone, etc. It is
therefore of necessity contained in air, on an average to the extent
of about 1-3000 of its bulk in the general atmosphere, but locally
in considerably higher proportions because of proximity to sources
of formation, and of its greater density as compared with air (1½ as
against 1). It may thus accumulate in inhabited buildings, in cellars,
wells, mines, caves; and it is contained in considerable proportion in
the air of the soil. Moreover, being easily soluble in water (to the
extent of an equal volume at the ordinary temperature and barometric
pressure) it is contained in all natural water, whether of rains,
rivers, springs or wells, and largely of course in that percolating the
soil. Such waters may therefore be considered as being acid solvents;
and as such, they exercise a far more energetic and far-reaching effect
than would pure water.</p>

<p><i>Carbonated water a universal solvent.</i>—While limestones are the
rocks most obviously acted upon by carbonated water, few if any resist
it altogether. Even quartz rocks of the ordinary kinds are attacked by
it; only the purest white crystalline quartzite may be considered as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
sensibly proof against it. Granite and the rocks related to it are
rather quickly acted upon, because of the presence of the feldspar
minerals containing potash, soda and lime as bases<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
together with alumina.</p>

<p>The results of this action are highly important; one being the
formation of clay, so essential as a physical ingredient of soils; the
other the setting-free of potash, one of the most essential nutrients
of plants. Hornblende and the related minerals are similarly acted
upon so far as they contain the same substances. In all cases, of
course, the silica (silicic acid) set free by the carbonic acid remains
partially or wholly in the resulting soils, as such. Lime also at first
mostly remains behind in the form of the carbonate; but potash and
especially soda compounds, being mostly readily soluble in water, are
largely carried away by the latter.</p>

<p>The effect of carbonated water upon silicate minerals is greatly
increased by the presence of ammonia (ammonic carbonate), which always
exists in atmospheric water to a greater or less extent. This effect
may readily be noted on the windows of stables, or other places where
animal offal decays, by the dimming of the glass surfaces; also in
glass bottles containing solution of ammonic carbonate.</p>

<p><i>Action of Oxygen.</i>—The effects of atmospheric <i>oxygen</i> on
rocks are of course confined to those containing substances capable
of farther oxidation. Chief among these are ferrous (iron monoxid)
and ferroso-ferric oxid the latter imparting bottle-green, bluish and
black tints to so many minerals and rocks that these colors may usually
be taken as indicating its presence. By taking up more oxygen the
ferrous and ferroso-ferric oxids are converted into ferric oxid or its
hydrate (rust), the tints mentioned passing thereby into brick-red or
rust color, according as the former or the latter (or sometimes their
intermixtures) is formed. In either case there is an increase in bulk;
and this when taking place in the cracks or crevices of minerals or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
rocks, tends, like the freezing of water, to widen the cracks and thus
to increase the surface exposed to attack. Since ferrous compounds,
when soluble in water, are injurious to plant growth, this oxidation
is of no little importance, and in soils must be carefully maintained
against a possible reversal.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to insist that the action of all these
chemical agents continues in the soils themselves, and that owing to
the fineness of the material, resulting in an enormously increased
surface exposed to attack, such action acquires increased intensity.
This is the more true as in soils bearing vegetation there are always
superadded the effects of the humus-acids resulting from the decay of
vegetable matter, as well as of the acid secretions of the living plants.</p>

<h4><i>Action of Plants and their Remnants<br> in Soil Formation.</i></h4>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Mechanical action.</i>—The direct action of plants
in forcing their roots into the crevices of rocks and minerals and
thus both widening them by wedging, and by exposing new surfaces to
weathering, has already been alluded to. That the mechanical force
exerted by root growth is very great, may readily be judged from their
effects in forcing apart, even to rupture, the walls of rock crevices;
but actual measurement has shown the force with which the root, <i>e.
g.</i>, of the garden pea penetrates, to be equal to from seven to ten
atmospheres, say from 200 to over 300 pounds per square inch. Such a
force, exerted under the protection of the corky layer protecting the
root tips, often produces surprising effects.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Chemical action.</i>—Vegetation takes a most important
part, from a chemical point of view, both in the first formation of
soils and in their subsequent relations to vegetable life. The lower
forms of vegetation are usually the first to take possession of rock
surfaces; foremost among these are the lichens. In humid climates we
find these crust-like plants incrusting more or less all exposed rock
surfaces, sometimes with a solid mantle that can be peeled off in wet
weather, showing the corroded rock-surface, and the beginnings of soil
clustering amid the root-fibrils beneath. A microscopic examination of
the substance of these lichens often shows as a prominent ingredient,
crystals of oxalate of lime, the lime having of course been derived
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
from the rock, while the oxalic acid has been formed by the plant and
used in the corrosion of the rock minerals. When it is remembered that
this acid is comparable in strength to hydrochloric and nitric acids,
the energy of the attack of the lichens is explained. Its progress can
often be traced, even beyond the visible root fibers, by a change in
the color of the rock; <i>e. g.</i>, from rust-color to brick red.</p>

<p>When by the action of the lichens a certain depth of loosened rock
or half-formed soil has been produced, the next step is usually the
advent of various mosses, which gradually shade out the crust-like
lichens, while the erect kinds persist for some time. Eventually
the mosses, after having increased still farther the soil layer on
the rock surface, are themselves partially or wholly displaced by
the hardier species of ferns; and with these the higher flowering
plants, such as the stonecrops and saxifrages (the latter deriving
their name from their “rock-breaking” effect), the heather, and many
other or shallow-rooted plants, gradually take possession. The roots
of all plants secrete carbonic acid; and many of them, much stronger
vegetable acids, such as oxalic and citric. In the crevices of rocks
we commonly find the roots forming a dense network over the surfaces,
the marks of which show plainly the solvent effect produced on the rock
by the root secretions. This is most readily observable on a polished
marble surface, or on feldspathic rocks. Of course the progress of
soil-formation is very much more rapid when, as in the case of powdered
lava (volcanic ash) and rock debris resulting from the effects of frost
etc., the surface is very much increased. In tropical climates, where
both vegetative and chemical action is most intense, it takes some of
the higher plants only a few years after a volcanic eruption to take
possession of portions of the “ash” surfaces; thus helping to form a
soil on which after a few more years agricultural plants such as the
vine and olive yield paying returns.</p>

<p>To this direct action of the higher plants is always added, to a
greater or less extent, that of innumerable bacteria, as well as molds;
whose vegetative and secretory action materially assists that of the
roots, and the weathering process in general.</p>

<p><i>Humification.</i>—While the mechanical action of the roots and the
chemical effect of the acids of their root secretions are very efficient
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
in promoting the transformation of mere rock powder into soil material
proper, the efficacy does not end with the life of the plant. In the
natural process of decay to which the roots are subject after death,
and which also affects the leaves, twigs and trunks falling on the
surface, the vegetable matter suffers a transformation which must be
considered more in detail hereafter, and results in the formation
of the complex mixture of dark-tinted substances known as vegetable
mold or <i>humus</i>; the remnant of vegetation that imparts to
surface soils their distinctive dark tint. Its functions in soils are
both numerous, and important to vegetable growth; as regards soil
formation, it assists disintegration of the rock minerals both by the
formation of certain fixed, soluble acids capable of acting on them
with considerable energy, and by the slow but continuous evolution of
carbonic acid under the influence of atmospheric oxygen, which has been
alluded to above.</p>

<p><i>Causes influencing chemical action and decomposition.</i>—The
chemical processes causing rock decomposition are of course continued
in the soil, and there also are materially influenced by climatic and
seasonal conditions, which bring about great differences in the kind
and intensity of chemical action.</p>

<p>Within the ordinary limits of solar temperatures it may be said that,
other things being equal, the higher the temperature the more intense
will be chemical action in soil formation. Since, however, water is
a potent factor in the majority of these processes, the presence or
absence of moisture at the same time with heat will cause material
differences in the kind and intensity of chemical action. In view of
the importance of carbonic acid as a chemical agent, the presence or
absence of vegetable matter or humus, from which by oxidation or decay
carbonic and humus-acids are formed, will likewise be of material
influence.</p>

<p>The presumption that climatic and seasonal conditions must greatly
influence both the kind and rapidity of the soil-forming processes, is
fully borne out by observation and practice. Especially is the amount
and distribution of rainfall of great importance in this respect, and
should therefore be first considered.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<h4>INFLUENCE OF RAINFALL ON SOIL FORMATION;<br> LEACHING OF THE LAND.</h4>

<p>In the general consideration of the soil-forming processes, it has been
stated that soils formed by the disintegration of rocks “in place,”
<i>i. e.</i>, without removal from the original locality, are also
designated as “residual”; meaning thereby that only a portion of the
original rock remains to form the soil mass, while another portion has
been removed. To a slight extent this removal occurs by the partial
washing-away of the finest clay and silt particles; but the most
important action from the agricultural point of view is the removal
by leaching with the carbonated water of the atmosphere and soil, of
certain easily-soluble compounds formed in the process of chemical
decomposition of rocks and resultant soils. The nature of these
compounds is exemplified in the subjoined table giving the composition
of some waters flowing from drains in unmanured fields, laid at
depths of from two to three feet; and for comparison with these, the
composition of the water of some of the world’s large rivers, showing
what these largest drains carry into the ocean.</p>

<p>The analyses have in all cases, where necessary, been recalculated to
parts per million, and to oxids, from the published data.</p>

<p>The letter “c” indicates that the preceding figure has in the absence
of a direct determination been stoichiometrically calculated from the
data given, in order to complete the comparison.</p>

It will be noted that in all the drain waters, lime is the ingredient
most abundantly leached out, and as reference to the acids shows,
mainly in the form of carbonate, also in that of sulfate. Magnesia is
next in amount among the bases; next in amount is soda, largely in
the form of sodium chlorid or common salt. Potash is present only in
small but rather uniform amounts. Of the acids the carbonic is the most
abundant, sulfuric next; chlorin and silicic acid come next, in about
equal amounts. Nitric acid passes off in small, but still relatively
considerable amounts.</p>

<p>Comparison of the drain waters with the river waters, while showing a
general qualitative agreement, also shows a marked diminution of total
solids (from 285.7 to 188.7; hence “soft river water”), and especially
of lime (from 107.6 to 43.2), together with the carbonic acid with
which it is mostly combined; indicating a deposition of lime carbonate
in the river deposits or alluvial lands. There is, on the other hand,
little if any general difference in the magnesia content of the two
classes of waters; nearly the same is true of soda, so that these two
bases really show a considerable relative increase when the diminished
total is considered. Potash remains about the same all through, viz.
two parts or a little more; phosphoric acid shows a fraction of one
millionth; nitric acid varies greatly but is usually higher in the
drain waters, sometimes showing a heavy depletion of the land by the
leaching-out of this important plant food.</p>

<p>It has been computed by John Murray, as quoted by Russell,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
that the volume of water flowing into the sea in one year, including all
the land areas of the earth, is about 6524 cubic miles. From the average
composition of river waters as given above, it would follow that nearly
five billions (4,975,117,588) of tons of mineral matter are annually
carried away <i>in solution</i> from the land into the sea. The amount
of <i>sediment</i> carried at the same time is many times greater;
in the case of the Mississippi river, it is more than five times the
amount of the matter carried in solution.</p>

<p>Comparison of the river waters among themselves shows less of any
consistent relation to climatic conditions than might have been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
anticipated. The waters of the arctic streams Yukon and Dwina show
wider differences than any two other waters in the list, unless it
be the St. Lawrence, another northern stream. The Missouri and Rio
Grande show by their high content of soda, chlorin and sulfuric acid
their origin in arid climates, where alkali lands prevail. The water
of the Nile is here represented by two analyses,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
one showing the season when the water is “red” and of high fertilizing quality
because of the sediment it brings down from the mountains of Abyssinia; the
other the “green” and relatively clear water which comes from the
great lakes and through the “sudd ” or grassy swamp region near the
junction of the Gazelle river with the Nile. Of the analyses given of
the Mississippi river water, the first represents the average of a full
year’s observations made weekly under the auspices of the New Orleans
Commission on Sewerage and Drainage, by J. L. Porter. The fourth is
an analysis made of water taken at the same point in May, 1905; the
analysis having been made in full by Mr. Stone, of the Reclamation
Service of the U. S. Geol. Survey, the direct determination of potash
and soda being in this case included. As will be seen, and might be
expected, the average of the Mississippi water corresponds quite nearly
to that of nineteen of the world’s great rivers as given by Murray. The
very great variation in the content of sulfates is evidently due to the
occasional heavy influx of the gypseous waters of the Washita and Red
rivers when in flood; while the minimum content (in January) agrees
almost precisely with the general average. Murray’s table would hardly
be changed if these analyses of Mississippi water were incorporated
therein, owing doubtless to the large and varied drainage area of the
great river.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
<i>Sea Water.</i>—The nature of the substances permanently leached
out is also seen by considering the composition of sea water, since
the ocean is the final reservoir for all the leachings of the land. It
might be objected that the ocean may have received its salts from other
sources; but this objection is overborne by the fact that substantially
the same salts are found in landlocked lakes, in which, as they have no
outflow, the leachings of the adjacent regions are perforce, as a rule,
the only possible source of the salts. It is true that the nature of
the salts differs somewhat in different lakes, as might be expected;
but a general statement of that nature will, after all, be the same as
that made in regard to sea-water. The following table of the average
composition of sea-water, according to Regnault, illustrates these facts.</p>

<p>The average saline contents of sea-water would thus be 3.505 per cent
In twenty-one determinations of the saline contents of the Atlantic
Ocean, the percentage ranged from 3.506 to 3.710 per cent Of this mineral
residue, common salt constitutes from about 75 to over 80 per cent.</p>

<div class="blockquot fs_90">
<p>We see that most prominent among the ingredients mentioned here is
common salt (sodium chlorid), which forms nearly four-fifths of the
total solid contents. Next in quantity are the compounds of magnesium,
viz. Epsom salt and bittern, with a very small amount of the bromin
compound. Next come the compounds of calcium (lime), of which gypsum is
the more abundant, while the carbonate, so abundant on the land surface
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
in the various forms of limestone, is present in minute amounts only,
yet enough to supply the substance needed for the shells of shellfish,
corals, etc. Least in amount of the metallic elements mentioned is
potassium. Calculating the total amounts of chlorin, we find that
it exceeds in weight any one other element present in the salts of
sea-water, being two-sevenths of the whole solids.</p>

<p>Substantially the same result, with variations due to local causes,
as exemplified in the varying composition of river and drain waters,
is obtained when we consider the saline ingredients of lakes having
no outlet, and in which therefore, the leachings of the tributary
land area have accumulated for ages. The Great Salt Lake of Utah, the
landlocked lakes of the Nevada basin, of California, Oregon, and of the
deserts of Asia, Africa, and Australia, all tell the same tale, which
may be summarized in the statement that the chlorids of sodium and
magnesium, and the sulfates of sodium, magnesium and calcium constitute
the bulk of the leachings of the land; while of other substances
potassium alone is present in relatively considerable amount.</p>

<p>While the above analysis shows the ingredients of sea-water so far
as they can at present be directly determined by chemical analysis, yet
the presence of many others is demonstrable, directly or indirectly,
from various sources. One is, the mother-waters from the making
of sea-salt, in which such substances accumulate so as to become
ascertainable by chemical means, and even become industrially available
in the cases of potash and bromin. Another is the ash of seaweeds,
which is indisputably derived from the sea-water, and contains, among
other substances not directly demonstrable in the original water,
notable quantities of iodin (of which this ash is a commercial source),
iron, manganese, and phosphoric acid. Again, the copper sheathing of
vessels, as it is gradually corroded, becomes more or less rich in
silver, manifestly thrown down from the sea-water, and the silver so
obtained is associated with minute amounts of gold. Copper, lithium,
and fluorin likewise have been found in sea water; and it is probable
that close search would detect very many of the other chemical elements
as ordinary ingredients in minute amounts. This is what must be
expected from the fact that few mineral substances known to us are
entirely insoluble in pure water, and still fewer in water charged with
carbonic acid. The latter is always present in sea-water and holds the
lime carbonate in solution; on evaporation or boiling, this substance
is the first to be precipitated; and thin sheets of limestone from
this source are commonly found at the base of rock-salt beds, which,
themselves, are evidently the result of the evaporation of segregated
bodies of sea-water in past geological ages.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
Summing up the facts concerning the water of the sea and of landlocked
lakes, with reference to the ingredients of soils needful for the
nutrition of plants, it appears that the rock ingredients leached out
in the largest amounts (lime alone excepted) are those of which the
smallest quantities only are required by most plants; while of those
specially needful for plant nutrition, only potash is removed in
practically appreciable amounts by the stream drainage.</p>

<p><i>Result of insufficient Rainfall; Alkali Soils.</i>—When the
rainfall is either in total quantity, or in consequence of its
distribution in time, insufficient to effect this leaching, the
substances that otherwise would have passed into the drainage and the
sea are wholly or partially retained in the soil; and when the rainfall
deficiency exceeds a certain point, the salts thus retained may become
apparent on the surface in the form of saline efflorescences, or as
it is usually termed in North America, “alkali.”<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
Their continued presence modifies in various ways the process of soil
formation and the nature of the soils as compared with those of regions
of abundant rainfall (“humid climates”); one of the most prominent
and important results being that, besides the easily soluble salts
mentioned above, the <i>carbonate of lime</i> formed in the process of
decomposition is also retained, and imparts to the soils of regions of
deficient rainfall (“arid climates”) the almost invariable character of
<i>calcareous</i> lands. There is thus in the United States a marked
and practically very important contrast between the soils of the arid
region west of the Rocky Mountains and those of the “humid” region
between the immediate valley of the Mississippi and the Atlantic coast.
These differences and their practical bearings can be best discussed
after first considering more in detail the chemical decomposition of
the several soil-forming minerals.</p>

<span class="h_subtitle">THE MAJOR SOIL-FORMING MINERALS.</span></h3>
</div>

<p>Since the several stratified rocks, such as sandstones, shales,
claystones, clays, limestones, etc., are themselves but the outcome of
the same disintegrating and decomposing influences upon the crystalline
rocks by which soils are now formed, we must study the action of these
influences upon the minerals composing the latter rocks in order to
gain a comprehensive understanding of the subject. While the number
of different minerals known to science is very large, such study need
not go beyond a small number of the chiefly important, rock-forming
species which are so generally distributed as to require consideration
in this connection. These minerals are the following: Quartz and its
varieties; the several feldspars; hornblende and augite; the micas;
talc and serpentine. Calcite, gypsum and dolomite, though not contained
in the older rocks, must be considered because of their forming large
rock deposits by themselves; and zeolites require mention because,
though rarely forming a large proportion of rocks, they are of special
importance as soil ingredients.</p>

<p><i>Quartz</i> and the minerals allied to it consist essentially of
dioxid of silicon, usually without (quartz proper) but partly also
with water in combination (opal and its varieties). <i>Silicon</i>
is next to oxygen the most abundant element found on the earth’s
surface. It occurs largely in the various forms of quartz, alone, or
as one ingredient of compound rock-masses; the rest, in combination
(as silica) with various metallic oxids, forms the important group of
silicate minerals, constituting the bulk of most rocks.</p>

<p>Quartz occurs frequently in crystals (rock crystal; six-sided prisms
terminated by six-sided pyramids), clear or variously colored; but more
abundantly as quartz rock or quartzite, readily known by its hardness,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
so as to strike fire with steel, and by its glass-like, irregular
fracture. Besides the crystalline quartz rock we find close-grained and
at least partly non-crystalline varieties, such as hornstone and flint.
Sandstones most commonly consist of grains of quartz cemented by some
other mineral, or by silica itself; in the latter case the siliceous
sandstone frequently passes insensibly into true quartzite. The loose
sand so well known to common life is prevalently composed of quartz
grains, whose hardness and resistance to weathering enables them to
survive longest the soil-forming agencies.</p>

<p>Quartz and its allied rocks—jasper, hornstone, siliceous schist,
etc., are all, as already stated, acted on with difficulty by the
“weathering” agencies. Crystalline quartz rock may be considered as
practically refractory against all but the mechanical agencies, and
hence remains in the form of sand and gravel, more or less rounded
by attrition, as a prominent component of most soils; sometimes to
the extent of over 92 per cent, even in soils highly esteemed in
cultivation, especially in the arid region. Such soils are mostly
the result of the disintegration of sandstones, the cement of which
has been dissolved out in the course of weathering; or they may be
derived directly from geological deposits of more or less loose and
unconsolidated sand. Among crystalline rocks, granites, gneiss and
mica-schists are those most usually concerned in the formation of
sandy soils; since in common parlance, quartz is understood to be the
substance of the sand unless otherwise stated. The exceptions are
especially important in the regions of deficient rainfall.</p>

<p>But while crystalline quartz is practically insoluble in all natural
solvents, the same is not true of the jaspers and hornstones. These
consist of a mixture of crystalline and amorphous (non-crystalline)
silica, which is more readily soluble than the crystalline, and is
attacked by many natural waters, especially by those containing even
very small amounts of the carbonates of potash or soda. We thus often
find that hornstone and jasper pebbles buried in the soil, while still
hard internally, have externally been converted into a friable, almost
chalky substance, consisting of crystalline quartz from which the
cementing amorphous silex has been removed by the soil water. In the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
course of time such pebbles may be completely destroyed by this
process, so as to be light and chalky throughout, and readily crushed
in tillage. The change is the more striking when, as frequently
happens, the hornstone pebble is traversed by small veins of
crystalline quartz, which remain as a skeleton.</p>

<p><i>Solubility of Silica in Water.</i>—It is easily shown
experimentally that the compound of silica with water (hydrate) is
under certain conditions readily soluble not only in pure water, but
also in such as contains carbonic acid. It thus occurs in nearly all
spring and well waters; some hot springs deposit large masses of it
(sinter); and geological evidence clearly demonstrates that quartz
veins have as rule been formed from water-solutions of silica.</p>

<p>That silica in its soluble form circulates freely in the soil water,
is abundantly evident from the large amounts of it which are secreted on
the outside of the stems of grasses, horsetail rushes and other plants,
imparting a gritty roughness to their outer surface. In the case of
the giant bamboo grass of Asia, the silica accumulated on the outside
of the joints forms a hard sheath of considerable thickness, known to
commerce as tabashir.</p>

<p>That among the first products of rock decomposition we often find
small amounts of the silicates of the alkalies (potash and soda) has
already been mentioned. It cannot be doubted that the same continues
to be formed in soil containing the proper minerals; and there they
also take part in the formation of the easily decomposable hydrous
silicates designated as <i>zeolites</i>, which are largely instrumental
in retaining the “reserve” of mineral plant-food in soils.</p>

<h4>SILICATE MINERALS.</h4>

<p>Silica occurs in nature combined with the oxids of most metals, forming
silicates; but most abundantly with the earths (lime, magnesia,
alumina) and alkalies (potash and soda). These compounds are the most
important in soil formation; and among them the following are the chief:</p>

<p>The <i>Feldspars</i>, which may be defined as compounds of silicates of
potash, soda or lime (either or all) with silicate of alumina. They are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
prominent ingredients of most crystalline rocks; potash feldspar
(orthoclase) with quartz and mica forms granite and gneiss; feldspars
containing soda and lime (either or both) form part of many other
crystalline rocks, such as basalt, diabase, diorite, gabbro and most
lavas. The feldspars are decomposed by weathering rather readily, and
are important in being the chief source of clays as well as of potash
in soils. When acted upon by carbonated water, the bases potash, soda,
and lime or carbonates, the silica being mostly displaced; while the
silicate of alumina takes up water and forms <i>kaolinite</i>, the
essential basis of clays, and one of the most important constituents of
soils; imparting to them the necessary firmness and cohesion, together
with other important physical properties, discussed more in detail
hereafter.</p>

<p>While thus on the one hand feldspars are the source of clay, on the
other they supply one of the most essential ingredients of plant food,
viz. potash; which is first dissolved by the water in the forms of
carbonate and silicate, but in most cases soon becomes fixed in the
soil by forming more complex (zeolitic) combinations. The soda not
being retained by the soil as strongly as is potash is washed through
into the country drainage; while if lime is present, it mostly remains
in the form of the carbonate.</p>

<p>Orthoclase feldspar contains nearly 17% of potash; Leucite, a related
mineral occurring in some lavas, contains 21.5%. The other feldspars
contain only a few per cent, sometimes none.</p>

<p>Other silicate minerals, so far as they contain the same bases, are
acted upon similarly to the feldspars.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">In the decomposition of the feldspars by
carbonated water, the compounds of potash and soda so formed are
soluble in water, those of lime and magnesia are insoluble or nearly
so. Hence pure clays can be formed only in the decomposition of the
potash-and soda-feldspars (orthoclase, albite) while in the case of
lime feldspar (labradorite) and the mixed feldspars (plagioclase,
anorthite) calcareous clays (marls) are the result. Lime feldspar
resists decomposition more tenaciously than do those containing large
proportions of the strong bases potash and soda; potash feldspar
especially is attacked most readily, and is the main source of the
formation of the valuable deposits of porcelain earth or <i>kaolin</i>,
which is essentially a mixture of kaolinite with fine silex and more or
less of undecomposed feldspar, and is of a chalky texture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
<i>Formation of Clays.</i>—When instead of remaining in place, this
kaolin is washed away and triturated in the transportation by water,
it is partially changed from its original chalky condition to that
plastic and adhesive form which is the characteristic ingredient of
all clays. The remarkable properties of this substance and the part
it plays in the physical constitution of soils, will be discussed in
another chapter. Its lightness and extreme fineness of grain (if grain
it can be called) cause it to be carried farther on by the streams than
any other portion of the products of rock decomposition save those
actually in solution; it can therefore be deposited only in water
that is almost or quite still (as in swamps) so long as the latter is
fresh. So soon however as brackish or salt water is encountered, clay
promptly gathers into floccules (“flocculates”), and thus enveloping
the finest-grained silts that may have been carried along with it, it
quickly settles down, forming the “mud banks” and heavy clay soils that
are so characteristic of the lower deltas of rivers, as well as of
swamps formed by the backwater or overflow of the same.</p>

<p>When instead of potash feldspar alone, the lime- or soda-lime feldspars
are also concerned in the decomposition process, the resulting clay
soils will be more or less calcareous, while the soda, as stated above,
is for the greater part leached out permanently.</p>

<p><i>Hornblende</i> (Amphibole) and <i>Pyroxene</i> (Augite). These are
two very widely diffused minerals, differing but little in composition
though somewhat differently crystallized, mostly in short columnar
forms. The typical and most abundant varieties of these minerals appear
black to the eye, though in thin sections they are bottle-green; they
form the black ingredient of most rocks.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">The color is due to ferroso-ferric
(magnetic) oxid of iron; the mineral as a whole may be considered as a
silicate of lime, magnesia, alumina and iron, varying greatly in their
absolute proportions; alumina and iron being sometimes almost absent.
When iron is lacking the mineral may be almost white (tremolite,
asbestos), and its weathering is then much retarded, since the oxygen
of the air cannot take part in the process of disintegration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
The black variety of hornblende is not only the most abundant as
a rock-ingredient, but it also the one most easily decomposed and
therefore most commonly concerned in soil formation. The black
hornblende owes its easy decomposition under the atmospheric influences
to two properties; one, its easy cleavage, whereby cracks are readily
formed and extended by the agencies already mentioned (<a href="#Page_1">pp. 1-3</a>).
The other is its large content of ferrous silicate (silicate of iron
protoxide), whereby it is liable to attack from atmospheric oxygen;
the latter forms ferric hydrate (iron rust) out of the protoxide, thus
causing an increase of bulk which tends to split the masses of the
mineral in several directions, while the silex is set free. At the same
time the carbonic acid of the air converts the silicate of lime and
magnesia, which forms the rest of the mineral, into carbonates; and the
alumina present forms kaolinite, as in the case of the feldspars. There
is thus formed from this mineral, when alone, a strongly rust-colored,
more or less calcareous and magnesian clay, constituting the material
for rather light-textured “red” soils. In most cases however the
hornblende is associated in the rock itself with the several feldspars,
(mostly lime- and soda-lime feldspars) as well as with more or less
quartz. The rust-colored soils are therefore most commonly the joint
result of the weathering of these several minerals. This is well
exemplified in the case of the “red” soils formed from the so-called
granites and slates of the western slope of the Sierra Nevada of
California.</p>

<p><i>Pyroxene</i> or <i>Augite</i> so nearly resembles hornblende in its
chemical composition and crystalline form, that what is said of the
latter may be considered as applying to augite also. Owing however to
the absence of any prominent tendency to cleavage, the smooth crystals
of this mineral are attacked much less readily than is hornblende, so
that we often find them as “black gravel” in the soils formed from
rocks containing it. Such soils are particularly abundant and important
in the region covered by the great sheet of eruptive rocks (basalts,
so-called) in the Pacific Northwest, and on the plateau of South
Central India (the Deccan), and result likewise from the decomposition
of the black lavas of volcanoes; thus in the Hawaiian islands, and in
the Andes of Peru and Chile.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>Both hornblende and augite being either free from, or deficient in
potash, of coarse the soils formed from them are apt to lack an
adequate supply of this substance for plant use. This is markedly true
of hornblende schist or amphibolite rocks.</p>

<p><i>Mica</i>, commonly known as isinglass, is so conspicuous wherever
it occurs that it is more readily recognized than any other mineral.
It occurs in glittering scales in soils and sands, and in rocks it
sometimes forms sheets of sufficient size to supply the small panes for
the doors of stoves, lamp chimneys, etc., which being flexible are not
liable to break, but only gradually scale into very thin films, into
which it can also be split by hand. When white, (muscovite, phlogopite)
its scales are sometimes mistaken for silver by mine prospectors; when
yellow, for gold; but their extreme lightness should soon remove these
delusions. The composition of mica is not widely different from that of
the two preceding minerals; like these it sometimes contains much iron,
and is then dark bottle-green (biotite); this variety in weathering
becomes bright yellow, and soon disintegrates.</p>

<p>This mineral is so abundant an ingredient of many rocks and soils, that
one naturally looks for it to play some definite or important part in
soil formation. By its ready cleavage it favors the disintegration of
rocks; but it seems that owing to the extremely slow weathering of its
smooth, shining cleavage surfaces, it exerts no notable effect upon
the chemical composition of the soil, although, owing to its peculiar
character of fine scales, it sometimes adds not immaterially to the
facility of tillage in otherwise somewhat intractable soils. So far as
is known at present, its presence or absence does not constitute, in
itself, any definite cause or indication of the quality of any soil.
It may nevertheless be said that the rock in which it usually occurs
most abundantly—mica-schist, a mixture of mica and quartz—is known to
form, as a rule, lands of poor quality. On the other hand, the soils
derived from granites and gneisses, even when rich in mica, are usually
excellent, on account of their content of feldspars, and frequently of
other associated minerals.</p>

<p><i>Hydromica</i> differs from the preceding mainly in containing a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
larger proportion of combined water; but it hardly decomposes more
readily, and the rocks in which it mainly occurs (hydromica schists)
are refractory to weathering, and in any case do not yield soils of any
fertility, the mineral being associated simply with quartz.</p>

<p><i>Chlorite</i>, essentially a silicate of alumina and iron, somewhat
resembles mica but is deep green or black, in small scales. It forms
part of certain rocks (chlorite schists), which greatly resemble
the hornblende schists, but are usually inferior to the latter as
soil-formers, containing but little of any direct value to plant life.</p>

<p><i>Talc and Serpentine</i>, Hydrous silicates of magnesia, are
extensive rock-materials in some regions, and as such require mention
as soil-formers also. Serpentine usually forms blackish-green
rock-masses, that although soft disintegrate very slowly in the absence
of definite structure, and are attacked with some energy only when
charged—as is frequently the case—with ferrous oxide. The conversion
of this into ferric hydrate, so common in nature, here also serves as
the point of attack on a rock otherwise very stable; causing it to
crumble, even though slowly.</p>

<p><i>Talc</i> (the true “soapstone”) being usually free from iron, would
be even more slow than serpentine to yield to weathering, but that its
extreme softness and ready cleavage greatly facilitate its abrasion.
Thus talc schist, which is usually a mixture of talc with more or less
quartz, undergoes mechanical disintegration quite readily.</p>

<p>But the soils formed from either serpentine or talcose rocks are
almost always very poor in plant food, and sometimes totally sterile.
Magnesia, though an indispensable ingredient of plant food, is rarely
deficient in soils and unlike lime does not influence in any sensible
degree the process of soil formation. Magnesian rocks as a whole are
practically found to be not specially desirable soil-formers, even in
the form of magnesian limestones. They do not even, as a rule, contain
as many useful accessory minerals as are commonly found in limestones.
Moreover, an excess of magnesia over lime is injurious to most crops,
as is shown later (<a href="#Page_313">chapt. 18</a>).</p>

<p><i>The Zeolites.</i>—Zeolites may be defined as hydro-silicates
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
containing as bases chiefly lime and alumina, commonly together with
more or less of potash and soda, more rarely magnesia and baryta.
The water is easily expelled by heating, but is present in the basic
form, not merely as water of crystallization. All zeolites are readily
decomposed by chlorhydric and other stronger acids.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">The zeolites proper are not original rock
ingredients, but are formed in the course of rock decomposition
by atmospheric agencies, heated water, and other processes not
fully understood. They are therefore usually found in the cavities
and crevices of rocks that have been subject to the influence of
atmospheric or thermal waters, most frequently in eruptive rocks,
particularly in the vesicular cavities characterizing what is known
as amygdaloids. They are also found in the crevices of sandstones and
shales percolated by water, as well as in nodules of infiltration
(geodes), in which they are frequently associated with quartz. Those
found in the cavities of rocks are usually well crystallized wherever
room is afforded, and are readily recognized by their crystalline form;
they are mostly colorless, sometimes yellow or reddish.</p>

<p><i>Exchange of bases in Zeolites.</i>—Although zeolites rarely
form a large proportion of rock-masses and therefore do not enter
directly into the soil minerals to any great extent, their interest
in connection with soil-formation is very great, because of the
continuation, within the soil, of the same processes that bring about
their formation in rocks. Under the conditions existing in soils they
will naturally rarely form crystals, but will appear in the pulverulent
or gelatinous form, leaving the zeolitic nature of the material to be
inferred from its chemical behavior. Among these characters the ready
decomposability by acids has already been mentioned; another of special
importance in the economy of soils is the fact that when a pulverized
zeolite is subjected to the action of a solution containing either of
the stronger bases usually present (potash, soda or lime), such base
or bases will be partially or wholly taken up by the zeolitic powder,
while corresponding amounts of the bases originally present will pass
into solution.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">Thus when a hydrosilicate of soda and
alumina is digested with a solution of potassic chlorid or sulphate,
the soda may be partially or wholly replaced by potash, while the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
corresponding sodium salt passes into solution. In the case of
zeolites containing lime or magnesia or both, the action of potassic
or sodic chlorid will be to partially replace the lime, while calcic
and magnesic chlorids pass into solution, resulting in the partial
or complete replacement of the lime by one or the other, or by both
bases. It is important to note that, other things being equal, potash
is usually absorbed in greater amounts and is held more tenaciously
than soda. The process may frequently be partially or wholly reversed
again, by subsequent treatment with large amounts of solutions of the
displaced base or bases. Thus while a solution of potassic chlorid may
be made to expel almost completely the sodium present in analcite,
subsequent treatment with sodic chlorid solution will again almost
completely displace the potash before taken up. The same happens when
the natural mineral potash leucite, (<a href="#Page_32">see p. 32</a>)
of frequent occurrence in certain lavas, is pulverized and treated
with a sodic solution; resulting finally in the production of a mass
corresponding to natural analcite, the sodium mineral corresponding to
leucite.</p>

<p>In other words, in any zeolitic powder the alkaline or alkaline earth
bases present may be partially or wholly displaced by digestion with an
excess of solution of any of these, varying according to the amount of
solution employed, and the length of time and temperature of action.</p>

<p>This characteristic behavior of zeolites is exactly reproduced in
soils. Few soils permit any saline solution to pass through them
unchanged; solutions of alkaline chlorids filtered through soils almost
invariably cause the passing through of calcium and magnesium chlorids,
while a part of the alkaline base is retained; and as a matter of fact,
we find that this absorbing power of soils for alkaline bases is more
or less directly proportional to the amount of matter which may be
dissolved or decomposed with elimination of silica, by means of acids.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">This absorption of bases from solutions by
chemical fixation will be farther discussed later on; but it should
be mentioned here that both naturally and artificially, rock-masses
are very commonly cemented, wholly or in part, by zeolitic material.
Hydraulic concretes may be considered as sandstones or conglomerates
whose grains are cemented by a zeolitic cement consisting of silica,
lime and alumina, with usually some potash or soda, and of course
containing the basic water; hence unaffected by the farther action
of the latter substance after the time of setting has expired, which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
varies somewhat according to the nature of the material used. That
similar cements should occur in natural sandstones is to be expected;
thus we find not unfrequently that certain sandstones are materially
softened, and their resistance destroyed, by treatment with even
moderately dilute acid, while silica and the usual zeolite bases pass
into solution. It is not often, however, that zeolitic material alone
cements the sandstone; it is most frequently associated with siliceous,
calcareous and sometimes even with ferruginous cementing material.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<h4>CALCITE AND LIMESTONES.</h4>

<p><i>Calcite</i> or calcareous spar is one of the minerals most commonly
known in the crystallized form, and is readily recognized by its
perfect cleavage in three directions, producing cleavage forms with
smooth, rhomb-shaped faces (rhombohedrons); these are sometimes
colorless and perfectly transparent, and laid on printed paper show the
letters double. But it may be whitish-opaque, and of various colors,
which may also be imparted to the limestones formed from it. It is
readily distinguished from quartz, which it sometimes resembles, by its
cleavage, its inferior hardness, being easily scratched with a knife;
and by its effervescence with acids, the latter being the crucial test
when other marks are unavailable, as when it forms soft granular masses
or “marls.” In all cases it can be recognized by its crystalline form
under the microscope, even when the substance containing it has been
pulverized in a mortar. The great importance of this compound—calcic
carbonate—from the agricultural point of view renders it desirable
that it, as well as limestones as such, should be recognized, when
seen, by every farmer.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">In mass the pure mineral constitutes white
marble; colored or variegated marbles are more or less impure from the
presence of other minerals. Some compact limestones also are nearly
pure; and as supplying only a single ingredient of plant food these
would not be much better soil-formers than quartz or serpentine. But it
is quite otherwise with <i>common</i> limestones; the mass of which,
it is true, is formed of calc-spar, but owing to its origin, is in the
great majority of cases so far commingled with other matters of various
character, that limestones are popularly reputed to form the very best
soils. “A limestone country is a rich country” is a popular axiom to
which there are, on the whole, but few exceptions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
<i>Origin.</i>—Actual observation of what is happening at the present
time, as well as the examination of the rock as anciently formed, prove
conclusively that with insignificant exceptions, all limestones have
been formed from the framework and shells, and to some extent from the
bones, of marine and fresh-water organisms, ranging in size from the
extinct giants of the lizard relationship to those recognizable only by
the microscope. Owing to the solubility of lime carbonate in carbonated
water, the organic forms have often (in crystalline limestones) been
almost completely obliterated in some portions, but in others are so
preserved as to prove undeniably the similarity of origin of the whole,
and that they have been formed in relatively shallow water, as they are
to-day.</p>

<p><i>Impure Limestones as Soil-formers.</i>—From what has been said
regarding the composition of sea-water, it will readily be inferred
that a pure deposit of any one kind cannot easily be formed in it;
moreover, the matter held in mechanical suspension everywhere near the
coasts must very commonly be included within the calcareous deposits
formed off-shore. Hence few limestones dissolve in acids without
leaving a residue of sand, clay and various other substances, usually
even some organic matter not fully decomposed; sometimes less than
half of the mass is really lime carbonate. It is obvious that when
the solvent action of carbonated water is exerted upon such impure
limestones, a loose residue of earthy matters will remain behind. It is
by this process that a considerable proportion of the richest soils in
the world have been formed, which have given rise to the popular maxim
above quoted. They are emphatically “residual” soils; sometimes, it is
true, somewhat removed, by washing-away, from their point of origin,
but in many cases forming a compact soil-layer on top of the unchanged
rock, into which there exists every shade of transition. Striking
examples of such residual soils in place are seen in the black prairies
of the southwestern United States; they are mostly rather “stiff”
(clayey), and hence has arisen a local popular error, to the effect
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
that clay or “heavy” soils are always calcareous. On the other hand,
the blue-grass region of Kentucky, and most of the lands of the arid
regions are prominent examples of “light” calcareous soils.</p>

<div class="blockquot fs_90">
<p><i>Caves, Sinkholes, Stalactites.</i>—Perhaps the most striking
exemplification of the solvent power of carbonated water is seen in the
formation of limestone caves. As a matter of fact, the vast majority
of all existing caves is found in limestone formations; and such
formations, as will be more fully discussed hereafter, nearly always
bear a luxuriant vegetation. The water filtering through the vegetable
mold, in which carbonic acid is constantly being formed, becomes
charged with it, and on reaching the underlying rock, dissolves to a
corresponding extent the lime carbonate of which this rock wholly or
chiefly consists. When penetrating crevices it soon enlarges these, to
an extent proportioned to the length of time and the strength of the
solvent; and thus gradually subterranean passages or caves are formed,
which at first are almost always the bed of a stream, the mechanical
action of which accelerates the process of enlargement, until after
some time the water is perhaps drained off through some crevice to a
lower level, where the same process is repeated.</p>

<p>Sometimes the ceiling gives way, forming the funnel-shaped
“sinkholes” or “lime-sinks” so familiar in some of the Mississippi
Valley States. Sometimes the lime solution on reaching the ceiling of
the cave, instead of dropping down, evaporates there and eventually
forms icicle-like “<i>stalactites</i>” out of the dissolved substance;
while when dropping on the floor and thus growing upwards, the
corresponding formation is called “<i>stalagmite</i>.” These caves,
subterranean rivers, sinkholes, natural bridges and tunnels, etc.,
mostly owe their origin to this solvent action of carbonated water on
limestone formations.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The same occurs on a small scale, when calcareous land is underdrained;
the lime carbonate dissolved from the soil is partially deposited in
the drain pipes, which it frequently obstructs. Similarly, an impure,
porous deposit of calcareous tufa is frequently formed on the surface,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
at the foot or in rills of calcareous hills. When “hard” water, being
usually such as contains lime carbonate dissolved in carbonic acid, is
boiled, or long exposed to the air, carbonic gas escapes and the lime
salt is deposited partly on the walls of the kettle, partly forming a
pellicle on the surface of the water.</p>

<p><i>Dolomite</i>, or bitter spar, greatly resembles calcite in its
aspect and properties, although containing nearly half its weight
(47.6%) of magnesic, together with calcic carbonate. It is, however,
nearly always whitish-opaque; its crystalline and cleavage surfaces
are usually somewhat curved; and its effervescence with acids is
much less lively than in the case of calcite. Like the latter it
often forms pure granular rock deposits, frequently used instead of
marble and limestone, and under that designation. The dolomite rocks,
however, are much more subject to weathering than the non-magnesian
limestones, and it is a curious fact that in contradistinction to the
limestone regions proper, those having strongly magnesian limestones or
dolomites as their country rock are frequently remarkably sterile. In
some portions of Europe dolomite areas are sandy deserts, whose sand
consists of weathered dolomite, so pure as to offer no adequate supply
of mineral food to plants. In the United States, magnesian limestones
underlie the “barrens” of several States and thus seem to justify their
European reputation of being poor soil-formers. The exact cause of
this difference is not fully understood, for at first sight it is not
clear why the presence of the magnesian carbonate should interfere with
the well-known beneficial effects of the lime compound. O. Loew and
May<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
and others have, however, shown that a certain excess of lime
over magnesia in the soil is necessary to prevent the injurious effects
exerted by magnesic compounds on plant nutrition, in the absence of an
adequate supply of lime. This point will be discussed more in detail
farther on.</p>

<p><i>Selenite</i> or <i>Gypsum</i>, sulfate of lime with about 14 per
cent of water, though not as abundant in nature as the carbonate or
limestone, is a very widely disseminated mineral and often occurs in
large masses over considerable areas. These are undoubtedly in most
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
cases the result of evaporation of sea water (<a href="#Page_26">see p. 26</a>),
more rarely of the transformation of limestone. In mass it frequently
resembles the latter, but is readily distinguished by its softness; it
does not grit between the teeth, is readily cut with a knife and does
not effervesce with acids. Very commonly it occurs in crystals, which
are easily split into thin plates. The crystals are very frequently
found imbedded in gray or bluish, tough clays, in rosettes, or flat
sheets which mostly show characteristic incurrent angles (caused by
twinning), and are hence known as “swallowtail” crystals. Such sheets
of selenite are popularly called “isinglass,” which name however is
equally applied to the mineral mica (<a href="#Page_35">see p. 35</a>).</p>

<p>Gypsum is only exceptionally an abundant ingredient of soils; yet
such soils prevail quite extensively on the upper Rio Grande, in New
Mexico and adjacent portions of Chihuahua, Coahuila, and on the Staked
Plains of Texas. Here whole ranges of hills are sometimes composed of
gypseous sand, bear a scanty, peculiar vegetation, and are ill adapted
to agricultural use. It may be said in general that few naturally
gypseous soils are very productive. This is largely because of the very
heavy clays which commonly accompany it, as the compound itself is not
only not hostile to plant life but is in extended use as a valuable
fertilizer (“land plaster”) for special purposes. From causes not fully
understood as yet, it particularly promotes the growth of leguminous
plants, notably the clovers; and as stated in <a href="#Page_142">chapter 9</a>,
it also specially favors nitrification in soils. In the arid region it renders
important service in the neutralization of “black alkali” or carbonate
of soda in alkali soils. Being soluble in 400 parts of water, it easily
penetrates downward in most soils, and in doing so effects changes in
the zeolitic portions, setting free potash from silicates and thus
indirectly supplying plants with this essential ingredient in a soluble
form. About 200 pounds per acre is an ordinary dose.</p>

<p>For agricultural use the rock gypsum is ground in mills so as to be
easily distributed, and dissolved by the soil water. Frequently,
however, it occurs in the soft granular form (gypseous marl) requiring
only light crushing; thus in the hills bordering the Great Valley of
California, and in parts of New Mexico and Texas.</p>

<p><i>Iron Minerals.</i>—In connection with calcite and dolomite, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
several minerals constituting the common iron ores require mention. One
of these is:</p>

<p><i>Iron Spar</i> or siderite; carbonate of iron, corresponds in
composition to calcite and dolomite and crystallizes in the same
form. It sometimes occurs in large masses and is an important iron
ore, brownish-white in color, and when compact resists the attack
of atmospheric oxygen remarkably well. Like the carbonates of lime
and magnesia, it is soluble in carbonated water, and its deposits
are undoubtedly formed from such solutions. The latter are copiously
formed wherever fermenting or decaying organic matter is in contact
with iron-bearing materials, such as rust-colored sands or clays; and
if the solution so formed can percolate without coming in contact with
air, iron spar is formed. But whenever the solution comes in contact
with air, it absorbs oxygen and the ferrous carbonate is converted into
ferric hydrate or rust, mineralogically known as:</p>

<p><i>Limonite</i> or brown iron ore. This ore is frequently found
deposited on the upper surface of clay layers traversing sandy strata,
the clay having arrested the carbonate solution and thus given time
to the air to effect the change. Sometimes such deposits form great
masses in rock-caves, fissure-veins, or crevices; and like siderite,
it is an important iron ore, though frequently quite impure, as in the
case of <i>bog ore</i>, which is formed in ill-drained subsoils. It is
also sometimes found as the residue from the weathering of rocks rich
in hornblende or pyroxene, and in this, as well as in other cases, is
pulverulent, constituting <i>yellow ochre</i>. It makes a rust-colored
streak on biscuit porcelain or unglazed queensware. <i>It is the
coloring material of all yellow or “red” soils and clays</i>, as well
as of brown sandstones, which are cemented by it.</p>

<p>As is well known, such clays and sandstones become dark red by heating
or “burning,” as in the case of common brick clays; the brown or yellow
ferric hydrate losing its water and becoming red ferric oxid. The
latter sometimes occurs in nature in the impure, pulverulent condition,
constituting “red ochre”; but more commonly and abundantly it is found
in the form of</p>

<p><i>Hematite</i> or red iron ore, which is sometimes formed in nature by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
limonite losing its water, but more commonly in different ways. It
is but rarely found in soils and is of no special interest in that
connection.</p>

<p>A fourth form of iron ore, quite common in the soils of some regions, is</p>

<p><i>Magnetite</i> or magnetic iron ore, also known as lodestone. This
mineral, the oxygen-compound of iron corresponding to “blacksmith’s
scale,” also occurs in large masses and is an important and usually
a very pure iron ore. It occurs very commonly disseminated through
certain rocks, and in their weathering it remains unattacked and thus
passes unchanged into the soils and sands, constituting the “black
sand” so well known to gold miners and almost universally present in
the alluvial soils of the Pacific coast. These black grains are of
course attracted by the magnet and can thus be easily recognized and
extracted. In soils they are simply inert, like quartz sand.</p>

<p>But while the ore is of little interest to the farmer, it is quite
otherwise with the compound of this oxid with water, the ferroso-ferric
hydrate; intermediate in composition between the white ferrous and the
brown ferric hydrates. As mentioned above, the black silicate minerals,
such as hornblende and pyroxene, are bottle-green when seen in thin
sections. Nearly the same color, with modifications running toward
blue and bright green, is often seen in natural clays and rocks, and
is almost always caused by the ferroso-ferric hydrate. Such materials
always become red or reddish when heated by the formation of red ferric
oxid; while when exposed to damp air, they assume the rust color of
ferric hydrate.</p>

<p><i>Reduction of ferric hydrate in ill-drained soils.</i>—When such
oxidized, rust-colored clays or soils are exposed to the action of
fermenting organic matter, the first effect observed is the change of
color from rusty to bluish or greenish, by the reduction of the ferric
to ferroso-ferric hydrate. Afterward, if the action is continued,
the solution of ferrous carbonate (see above) may be formed, and the
greenish or bluish color may disappear.</p>

<p>The importance of this reaction to farming practice lies in the fact
that the blue or green tint, wherever it occurs, indicates a lack of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
aeration, usually by the stagnation of water, in consequence of
imperfect drainage. Such a condition, always injurious to plants,
becomes doubly so when it is associated with the formation of a
metallic solution, such as ferrous carbonate, and promptly results in
the languishing or death of plants in consequence of the poisoning of
their roots. In the presence of sulfates such as gypsum, the formation
of iron pyrite (ferric bisulfid) and sulfuretted hydrogen, is likely
to take place. Moreover, under the same conditions the phosphoric acid
of the soil may be concentrated into ferrous or ferric phosphate, which
pass into deposits of bog ore in the subsoil.</p>

<span class="h_subtitle">THE VARIOUS ROCKS AS SOIL-FORMERS.</span></h3>
</div>

<p><i>Rock-weathering in arid and humid Climates.</i>—From what has
been said in the preceding chapters of the physical and chemical
agencies concerned in rock-weathering, it is obvious that climatic
differences may materially influence the character of the soils formed
from one and the same kind of rock. Since kaolinization is also a
process of hydration, the presence of water must greatly influence
its intensity, and especially the subsequent formation of colloidal
clay; so that rocks forming clay soils in the region of summer rains
may in the arid regions form merely pulverulent soil materials. Many
striking examples of these differences may be observed, <i>e. g.</i>,
in comparing the outcome of the weathering of granitic rocks in the
southern Alleghenies with that of the same rocks in the Rocky Mountains
and westward, especially in California and Arizona. The sharpness of
the ridges of the Sierra Madre, and the roughness of the hard granitic
surfaces, contrasts sharply with the rounded ranges formed by the
“rotten” granites of the Atlantic slope, where sound, unaltered rock
can sometimes not be found at a less depth than forty feet; while
at the foot of the Sierra Madre ridges, thick beds of sharp, fresh
granitic sand, too open and pervious to serve as soils, cover the upper
slopes and the “washes” of the streams, causing the latter to sink
out of sight. A general discussion of the kinds of soils formed from
the various rocks must, therefore, take these differences into due
consideration.</p>

<h4>GENERAL CLASSIFICATION OF ROCKS.</h4>

<p>Rocks may be broadly classified into three categories, viz:</p>

<p>1. <i>Sedimentary</i> rocks, formed by deposition in water and hence
more or less distinctly stratified.</p>

<p>2. <i>Metamorphic</i> rocks, formed from rocks originally sedimentary,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
by subterranean heat in presence of water. Usually crystalline, that
is, composed of more or less distinct (large or minute) crystals of one
or several of the minerals mentioned above.</p>

<p>3. <i>Eruptive</i> rocks, ejected in the molten state from volcanoes or
fissures; crystalline or not, according to slow or rapid cooling.</p>

<p><i>Sedimentary Rocks.</i>—Sedimentary rocks are forming to-day by
deposition from either sea or fresh water, precisely as they were in
the most remote geological times; the oldest clearly sedimentary rocks
being sometimes undistinguishable in their nature and composition from
the very latest immediately preceding our present time. They may for
the purposes of the present work be simply classified as follows:</p>

<p>1. <i>Limestones</i>, formed in comparatively shallow seas, or fresh
water basins, from the calcareous shells or skeletons of various
organisms.</p>

<p>2. <i>Sandstones</i>, and conglomerates (sometimes called
pudding-stones) formed from the debris of pre-existing rocks
disintegrated by the agencies described above, (<a href="#Page_1">chap. 1-2</a>),
re-cemented by means of solutions of one or several substances, such as silex,
carbonate of lime, ferric hydrate and others. Loose sands and gravels
are the initial stages of such rock formation as well as the results of
their disintegration.</p>

<p>3. <i>Clays</i>, <i>Claystones and Clay shales</i>, consisting of
clay substance with more or less sand, and soft or hard according to
the nature of the waters or solutions that may have acted upon them,
with or without the aid of heat. These rocks can only be formed in
comparatively quiet or “back” waters, since clay would not ordinarily
be deposited in moving water.</p>

<p><i>Metamorphic Rocks.</i>—The effects of subterranean heat or
metamorphism upon the sedimentary rocks may be roughly stated as
follows:</p>

<p><i>Limestones</i> are transformed into marbles of various degrees of
purity, according to the nature of the original rocks.</p>

<p><i>Sandstones</i> when cemented by silex are transformed into
quartzite, of greater or less purity according to the nature of the
“sand” entering into its composition. When cemented by materials other
than quartz, these also will be segregated in the form of various
minerals in the body of the rock.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span></p>

<p>The <i>clay rocks</i> form the most varied products under the influence
of (aqueo-igneous) metamorphism; granites, gneiss, syenite and
hornblendic schist are among the most common. The great variations in
the composition of clayey materials account for the correspondingly
great variations in the nature of the resultant metamorphic rocks.</p>

<p><i>Igneous or Eruptive Rocks.</i>—These are usually divided into two
groups; the one characterized by a large proportion of free quartz
(silicic acid), and hence designated as <i>acidic</i>, and usually of
a light tint; the other the <i>basic</i>, containing little or no free
quartz, and commonly of a dark tint caused by the presence of a large
amount of iron (contained in pyroxene, more rarely in hornblende).</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">Of the latter class are the dark “basaltic”
rocks constituting the mass of the enormous eruptive sheet of the
Pacific Northwest, covering the greater part of Washington, Oregon
and northeastern California. The lavas of the Hawaiian islands are of
the same class and even more basic; while the eruptives of Nevada,
middle and southern California, and eastward to the Rocky Mountains,
are mostly of the light-colored, acidic type. The same is largely
true of the rocks of the Andes of Central and South America, the gray
“Andesites,” also represented in the Caucasus.</p>

<p>As one and the same eruptive material may, according to the greater or
less rapidity of cooling, appear as a glassy mass (obsidian, pumice,
volcanic ash, tuff, etc.,) or as a crystalline rock resembling coarse
granite in structure, it is not easy to identify them in all their
various forms. This can frequently be done only by ascertaining their
component minerals by the microscope, or by chemical analysis. The
same is sometimes true of metamorphic rocks; and as in the latter, the
several feldspars and quartz, with pyroxene instead of hornblende,
constitute the predominant soil-forming minerals. More rarely, garnet,
chrysolite, leucite and other silicates require consideration.</p>

<h4><i>Generalities regarding the Soils<br> derived from various Rocks.</i></h4>

<p>It is hardly necessary to insist that as in the case of the rocks
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
composed of single minerals, already referred to above, the predominant
mineral or minerals of compound rocks determine the facility of
weathering, as well as the quality of the soil resulting therefrom.
Since rocks are named essentially in accordance with the <i>kinds</i>
of minerals that constitute their regular mass, the <i>proportion</i>
in which the several constituents stand to each other may vary greatly.
Thus a <i>granite</i> may consist, over considerable areas, mainly of
a mixture of potash feldspar and quartz; in others, mainly of quartz
and mica with little feldspar. Very frequently, hornblende replaces
mica partially or wholly. The latter will weather much more slowly
than feldspar or hornblende, and will produce an inferior soil when
decomposed. Allowing for such variations, a fairly approximate general
estimate of the quality and peculiarities of soils from crystalline
rocks may nevertheless be made. To some extent such estimates must make
allowance not only for the chief ingredients, but also for those which
are called “accessory” or characteristic, and which while not present
in large amount, may nevertheless exert a considerable influence upon
the quality of the soil.</p>

<p><i>Soils from granitic and crystalline rocks.</i>—In the case of the
(potash-feldspar) granite soils it is generally admissible to expect
that they will be fairly supplied with phosphoric acid, because in
the great majority of cases, minute crystals of apatite (phosphate of
lime) are more or less abundantly scattered through it. From the potash
feldspar present, granite soils may always be relied on for a good
supply of potash for plant use; on the other hand, unless hornblende be
present, they are pretty certain to be deficient in lime, since neither
lime, feldspar nor calcite are probable accessory ingredients of this
rock.</p>

<p>Granite is exceedingly apt to weather by mechanical disintegration
far in advance of its chemical decomposition. It is therefore common
to find in sedentary soils overlying granite, a gradual increase of
grains of its component crystalline minerals as we descend in the
subsoil; until finally the latter grades off into rock almost unchanged
save in lacking coherence. This is seen strikingly in the southern
Appalachians, as well as in the Sierra Nevada and Sierra Madre of California;
at Cintra in Portugal, at Heidelberg in Germany, and elsewhere.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>

<p>But of the rocks that resemble granite and are popularly so called, a
good many are not “true to name” and therefore form soils differing
materially from the type just mentioned.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">Thus the so-called granite areas of the
Sierra Nevada of California are largely occupied by a rock containing,
besides quartz, chiefly soda-lime feldspar and some hornblende, and
scarcely any mica. It is more properly a diorite (grano-diorite);
the soils formed from it are rather poor in potash, not strongly
calcareous, and quite poor in phosphoric acid. On account of the
small proportion of hornblende (unusual in diorites), these soils are
light-colored (not “red”), and bear a growth of small pine instead of
the usual oak growth of the lower Sierra slopes.</p>

<p>What is said of granite soils is also generally true of those formed
from <i>Gneiss</i>, which is composed of the same minerals as granite,
but has a slaty cleavage and on that account when upturned on edge,
weathers rather more rapidly than most granites. Owing to the frequent
occurrence of lenticular masses of quartz in gneiss, its soils are
more commonly of a siliceous nature than are those of the true granite
regions, and not as “strong” as the latter. This is the more true since
gneiss often passes gradually into <i>mica schist</i>, which, being a
mixture of quartz and mica only, not only weathers very slowly but also
supplies but little of any importance to plants, to the soils formed
from it. Such soils would mostly be absolutely barren but for the
frequent occurrence in the rock, of accessory minerals that yield some
substance to the soil. Yet it remains true that inasmuch as gneiss and
mica-schists are among the rocks in which mineral veins most commonly
occur, the proverbial barrenness of mining districts is very frequently
traceable to these rocks. The same may be said of some of the related
rocks, such as gabbro, minette and others.</p>

<p>Normal <i>diorite</i> consists of hornblende and soda-feldspar, with
more or less quartz.</p>

<p>The soils derived from certain diorites of the Sierra Nevada of
California have just been referred to. But these granite-like diorites
are on the whole exceptional; it should be added that the (diabasic)
“greenstones” of the Eastern United States and of the Old World, which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
are usually much finer-grained, do not form the mass of fine, angular
debris constituting the subsoil in the Sierra Nevada, but weather into
rounded masses and fine-grained soils possessing, on the whole, a fair
fertility, though liable to contain an excessive proportion of silex in
various forms.</p>

<p>Of the <i>eruptive rocks</i> as a class it is often said that they form
very productive soils; yet, as these rocks differ widely from each
other in composition, this statement must be taken with a great deal of
allowance. Very many of them decompose with extreme slowness on account
of their glassy nature; this is particularly true of obsidian, pumice
stone, and the “volcanic ash” derived from its pulverization, and which
is found unchanged, in sharp scales, among the decayed minerals of
other rocks in complex soils. Other volcanic ash, however, being formed
by the pulverization of crystalline or of basic lavas, weathers rather
readily, as already stated; so that certain plants take possession in
the course of a few years. The general classification into basic and
acidic rocks, given above, is of importance in connection with soil
formation from eruptive masses; for the basic rocks are much more
easily attacked by the atmospheric agencies than the acidic class.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">A broad distinction must, however, be
made between the basic rocks of the basaltic class, which contain
black pyroxene as a prominent ingredient, and those which, like
many trachytes, are rich in feldspathic minerals. The latter are
naturally rich in alkalies (potash and soda) which they impart to the
corresponding light-colored soils; while the black basaltic rocks and
lavas weather into “red” soils, sometimes containing extraordinary
amounts of iron (ferric hydrate) and (from the lime-feldspars they
contain) a fair supply of lime, but oftentimes very little potash.
Experience seems to prove that the red basalt soils are mostly rather
rich in phosphoric acid; this is especially true of the country covered
by the great eruptive sheet of the Pacific Northwest, in the rocks
of which the microscope readily detects the presence of numerous
needles of apatite (lime phosphate). The same is true of the highly
iron-bearing soils from the black basaltic lavas of the Hawaiian
islands, even though they have been leached of all but traces of lime
and potash. All these soils are physically “light” and easily workable,
since the rocks in question contain but little alumina from which to
form clay; they are sometimes extremely rich in iron, even to the
extent of being capable of serving as iron ores.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
The soils derived from <i>trachytes</i> and trachytic lavas are
generally light-colored and light in texture; the latter from the
presence of a large proportion of volcanic glass, together with
undecomposed crystalline minerals. These are usually rich in potash,
but poor in lime and phosphates. The high quality of the wines of
the lower Rhine has been ascribed to these soils, which however vary
greatly within the areal limits of the production of the high-grade
wines, not only from gray trachytes to dark colored, highly augitic
basalt, but also to acidic quartz porphyries or rhyolites, and
clay-slates.</p>

<p>The rhyolites on the whole yield the poorest soils among the eruptive
rocks; they are slow to weather at best, and the soils produced are
poor and unsubstantial, largely from the predominance of quartz and
undecomposable, glassy material; of which the phonolites are the
extreme type, resisting the influence of the atmospheric agencies just
as would so much artificial glass. Soils consisting largely of volcanic
glass may be found covering considerable areas in the Sierra Nevada of
California. Such “volcanic ash” soils are usually very unthrifty, and
bear a growth of small pines.</p>

<p><i>Soils from sedimentary rocks.</i>—<i>Limestones</i>, when pure and
hard, are very slow to disintegrate, and are also very slowly attacked
by carbonated water (<a href="#Page_41">see chap. 3, page 41</a>). Soft impure
and vesicular limestones are, however, very rapidly attacked, especially when
underlying a surface clothed with the luxuriant vegetation that usually
flourishes on soils rich in lime. The popular adage that “a limestone
country is a rich country,” is of almost universal application and
stamps lime, from the purely practical standpoint, as one of the most
important soil ingredients.</p>

<p><i>Residual Limestone Soils.</i>—Striking examples of the formation of
large, fertile soil areas by the leaching out of limestones are found
in the States of Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas, where the
fertile black prairies have been largely thus formed. The “blue-grass”
country of Central Kentucky is another case in point.</p>

<p>The following table shows a representative example of the relative
composition of the (cretaceous) “Rotten Limestone” of Mississippi, and
the “residual” soil-stratum derived from it. The average thickness of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
the layer of residual clay above the limestone is about eight feet,
but ranges from seven to ten; the upper layers of the limestone are
somewhat softened, but the rock is always fresh at twelve feet, from
which depth the sample analyzed was taken, in a cistern adjoining
the field from which the soil and subsoil were procured. The black
soil varies in depth from 8 to 15 inches; then there is a change to
a brownish subsoil, reaching down to about two feet, and in drying
cleaving into prismatic fragments. The black soil has here in the
highest degree the peculiarity of crumbling in drying from its
water-soaked condition, so that it may be plowed when wet without
injury, although in the roads it works up into the toughest kind
of mud. The prairie is sparsely timbered with compact, fair-sized
black-jack oak, accompanied originally by red cedar.</p>

<p>The limestone derives its popular name of “rotten” from its being
usually soft enough to be cut with a knife or hatchet, and is therefore
somewhat used for building, and for burning lime.</p>

It appears from the above table that in the change from the original
limestone to the soil mass as found at three feet depth, 81.5% of the
lime carbonate has been eliminated by leaching, leaving behind somewhat
less than one fifth of the original mass. Taking the average depth of
the soil mass at 8 feet, this thickness of material has required about
45 feet of the rotten limestone. Considering that notwithstanding the
tenacity of the clay soil, some of it must in the course of time have
been washed away, we may safely assume that the original rock surface
was from 50 to 60 feet higher than at present.</p>

<p><i>Sandstone Soils.</i>—The indefiniteness of the nature of
“sandstones” as such renders generalizations in regard to the soils
formed from them rather difficult, save as to their physical qualities,
which in the nature of the case are always “light.” In the Old World
and in the humid region generally, sandstone and sandy soils are
usually spoken of as being poor, because there the sand almost always
consists of quartz grains only, and hence the fine portions alone
can be looked to for plant nutrition. Consequently, the more sand is
seen in a soil, the poorer it is usually presumed to be. But this
presumption would be wholly erroneous in the arid regions.
(<a href="#Page_86">See chapt. 6, p. 86</a>).</p>

<p>Clearly, the nature of the soils produced by the weathering of
sandstones depends upon two points: first, the nature of the cement
binding the sand grains, and second the character of the latter themselves.</p>

<p><i>Varieties of Sandstones.</i>—As has been stated above, the cements
may be roughly classified into five kinds, and their intermixtures,
to wit: <i>quartzose</i> or siliceous, <i>calcareous</i>,
<i>ferruginous</i>, <i>aluminous or clayey</i>, and <i>zeolitic</i>.
As regards the first, it is obvious that siliceous sandstones will
disintegrate with great difficulty, since neither the cement nor
the grains are susceptible of material change by weathering. Such
sandstones frequently pass insensibly into quartz rock, and the light,
unsubstantial soils they produce are of the poorest, containing often
mere traces of the plant-food ingredients. This of course, is true,
not only of the soils formed by the actual weathering of sandstones,
but equally of those consisting of quartz-sand deposited by water or
drifted by winds.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">Of this character are the pine-forest soils
of the coast region of the Gulf of Mexico, particularly the “Sand
hammocks” of the immediate Gulf border, from Mississippi Sound to
Charlotte Harbor, Florida; the sandy lands of the Grand Traverse region
of Michigan, and many other minor areas in the United States, usually
characterized by a pine growth, often more or less stunted, according
to the nature of the sand grains.</p>

<p><i>Calcareous sandstones</i> usually form a very much better class
of soils, partly for the intrinsic reason given above as regards
limestones as soil-formers. The calcareous cement is very rarely
pure calcite; in most cases it is very impure, as, most commonly,
is also the “sand” itself. This is explained from the fact that
such rocks (mostly soft and often quite unconsolidated) are, like
limestones themselves, the result of deposition in shallow seas or
lakes, receiving deposits from the land drainage, and enriched by the
animal and vegetable life of such waters. Not uncommonly they contain,
disseminated through them, grains of the mineral glauconite (a hydrous
silicate of iron and potash), which readily supplies available potash;
while the remnants of animals and plants furnish more or less of
available phosphates. Thus the general presumption regarding calcareous
sandstones is that the derived soils are of good quality, frequently
of the very best. The same, however, does not appear to be true of
sandstones cemented by dolomite; the soils derived from magnesian
sandstones are in many cases noted for their unproductiveness.
(<a href="#Page_42">See chapt. 3, p. 42</a>).</p>

<p><i>Ferruginous Sandstones</i> manifestly derive no important soil
ingredients from their cement when the latter is measurably pure ferric
hydrate; and when in addition the sand itself is purely siliceous, the
soils resulting from the disintegration of the rocks are very poor.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">Such are, e.g., the soils derived from
the ferruginous sandstones of the Lafayette formation in a part of
northern Mississippi and adjacent portions of Tennessee and Alabama,
characterized by small scrubby oak or dwarfed pine. On the whole,
however, such purely ferruginous quartz sandstones are exceptional, and
should not detract from the favorable inferences usually to be drawn
from the iron-rust tint of soils (<a href="#Page_283">see chapter 15</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
Sandstones with purely <i>zeolitic</i> cement are on the whole not of
frequent occurrence, the zeolites forming, more commonly, the hard
portion of a clay-sandstone cement, which disintegrates by their
weathering-out.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">In regions where the tufaceous rocks of
eruptives prevail, we not uncommonly find the “volcanic ash” solidly
cemented by a zeolitic mass, which is then usually apparent in cavities
or crevices in the form of crusts or crystals. Such tuffs are commonly
rich in alkalies and lime, but mostly poor in phosphates, and in
disintegration form soils of a corresponding nature. They are largely
represented in the valleys off Puget Sound, as well as in portions of
central Montana, and northward.</p>

<p><i>Clay-Sandstones</i> (argillaceous sandstones) when soft, as is
mostly the case, form as a rule desirable loam soils, of a generalized
composition, difficult to predict. It is here that the composition of
the sand grains themselves most frequently comes into play in modifying
the soil quality. From clay-sandstones to claystones of various degrees
of sandiness there is, of course, every grade of transition, the soils
ranging correspondingly in the scale of lightness or clayeyness.
As a general rule, the potash contents of such soils are sensibly
proportioned to the clayey ingredient, at least in the humid regions.</p>

<p><i>Claystones</i> (i. e., clays hardened by some one or more of the
cements mentioned in connection with sandstones), will in the nature of
the case, when disintegrated from the condition in which they lie in
the geological formations, make correspondingly clayey, heavy soils,
which as experience shows are usually rich in the ingredients of plant
food, but frequently too heavy and intractable in tillage to be readily
utilized.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">There are, of course, exceptions; such as
soils formed from pipe-clays, in which little if any mineral plant-food
remains, and which are best used for other purposes than agriculture,
unless under special conditions it may be worth while to reclaim them
by fertilization.</p>

<p><i>Natural Clays.</i>—Clays occur in nature in a great variety of
modifications that have received designations known in common life.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
Such are porcelain clay, pipe-clay, fire-clay, potters’ clay,
brick-clay, and many others of more or less local use only. As these
materials practically concern the farmer in very many cases, they may
properly find a brief discussion here.</p>

<p>The variety-names enumerated above in the order of the actual contents
of the materials in true clay substance (“colloidal clay”), are partly
based upon that fact, partly upon the degree of plasticity attained
by that substance, and essentially upon the nature and amount of
foreign admixtures associated with it. Thus, porcelain clay is chalky
kaolinite, sometimes associated with enough of pure white plastic
clay to render it workable in the potter’s lathe, but more commonly
requiring to be molded in porous molds; it is very refractory to heat.
Pipe-clay is also white, but more plastic and usually less refactory.
Fire-clay is a refractory pipe-clay commingled with some coarse
infusible material, such as quartz sand (or the same clay burnt and
crushed), in order to prevent excessive contraction and change of shape
in drying and burning. Potters’ clay is a much less pure, and from that
cause more fusible clay, which when burnt forms at a moderate heat
a semi-fused, more or less hard mass, such as crockery and pottery
ware. Brick-clay is a still more impure clay, or loam, containing
considerable sand and usually iron oxid, and largely falls already
within the limits of tillable soils or subsoils, rendered fusible by
the presence of relatively considerable amounts of iron, magnesia and
lime.</p>

<div class="blockquot fs_90">
<p><i>Iron</i> colors natural clays either red, yellow, green or blue;
the latter two colors turning to yellow or red on exposure to the air,
and to red on burning. Black color is usually due to carbon, such clays
often turning white on heating.</p>

<p>Clays containing much lime are usually of a gray or whitish tint,
and like the soft crumbly limestones are often called marls, and are
used as such for land improvement. But it should be understood that the
colors of clays, mostly derived from some iron compound, have little
to do with their uses in the arts, except that no deeply colored clay
(black excepted) is refractory in the fire.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span></p>

<h4><i>“Colloidal” Clay.</i><a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></h4>

<p>In connection with soils, clay may be defined, in the most general
terms, as being the substance which imparts plasticity and adhesiveness
to soils when wetted and kneaded, and which, when heated to redness,
loses this property completely and permanently, becoming hard and
coherent in proportion to the degree of heat to which it is exposed.</p>

<p>In common life, however, the name is applied to the whole of any
naturally occurring earth which on wetting and kneading assumes a
reasonable degree of plasticity and adhesiveness. When the latter
property becomes nearly or quite insensible, the earth is designated as
a “loam,” more or less “clayey” according to the amount of the pure,
plastic and adhesive material associated with the mineral powders and
sand that form the bulk of most soils.</p>

<p>Chemically, the pure clay substance<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
probably consists (as has been stated above) of silica and alumina
in the proportion of nearly 46 to 40, the rest (14%) being water of
hydration, which is lost on burning the clayey material. But while it
is true that such is the composition of the plastic substance of clays,
plasticity and adhesiveness are by no means invariable properties
of this compound. In its purest state, as kaolinite, it is readily
mistaken for chalk, (and is sometimes used as such), being powdery to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
the touch and entirely devoid of plasticity<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
when wetted and kneaded. The microscope shows this chalky kaolinite
to consist of minute, mostly rounded, originally six-sided, thin
plates, which when pure resemble to the touch powdered talc (soapstone)
or even black-lead, rather than any clay known to common life. But
being exceedingly soft, the kaolinite substance is easily ground or
triturated into an extremely fine powder; and Johnson and Blake<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
succeeded in producing sensible plasticity and adhesiveness by
long-continued trituration of kaolinite with water in a mortar. A
similar process, but continued much longer by the mechanical agencies
concerned in soil-formation (<a href="#Page_1">see chapt. I</a>), is unquestionably
the chief factor concerned in the formation of natural plastic clays; but whether
this is the <i>only</i> process by which the powdery kaolinite may be
transformed into plastic clay, is a question not definitely settled. It
is at least possible that repeated freezing and thawing, as well as the
action of hot water, may take a part in the transformation, beyond that
by which they destroy the crumbly (flocculated) structure of soils and clays,
and render them plastic; as is done in the maturing of clays by potters.</p>

<p><i>Causes of Plasticity.</i>—In any case the property of plasticity
and adhesiveness is restricted to the particles so fine that they fail
to settle, in the course of 24 hours, through a column of pure water
eight inches (200 m) high, while some are so extremely minute that
they will not settle for many months, and even for several years.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
Such turbid “clay water” may sometimes be found existing in nature, in
moist, secluded places, for weeks after the subsidence of the overflows
of rivers whose water is exceptionally free from dissolved mineral matter.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot fs_90">
<p><i>Separation of Colloidal Clay.</i>—This property of the plastic
clay substance, of diffusing in pure water, furnishes the means of
separating from it the coarser, sandy and silty portions of soils and
natural clays, and observing its characteristic properties, so far as
the almost unavoidable admixture of some other substances, presently to
be considered, permits.</p>

<p>In natural soils the clay particles usually incrust the powdery
ingredients, cementing them together; or themselves form complex
aggregates (floccules) of large numbers of individual particles. These
may be loosened from their adhesion or cohesion either by prolonged,
gentle kneading of the wet clay, or by more or less prolonged digestion
(soaking) in hot water, or more expeditiously, by lively boiling with
water. The boiling should not, however, be prolonged beyond the time
actually required for disintegration, since (as Osborne<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
has shown) long-protracted boiling tends to render the clay permanently
less diffusible.</p>

<p>From the turbid clay-water the diffused clay may be obtained either
by evaporating the water (which as the bulk is very large, is usually
inconvenient), or, more conveniently, by throwing it down from its
suspension by the action of certain substances which possess the
property of curdling (coagulating) the clay substance into flocculent
masses that settle quickly. Of all known substances, lime, in the
form of lime-water, acts most energetically in producing this change;
but other solutions of lime, as well as most salts and mineral acids,
produce the same effects when used in sufficient quantity. Common
salt is among the most convenient, because it can most readily be
leached out of the clay precipitate thus thrown down. This when white,
resembles boiled starch, but being usually colored by iron might be
easily mistaken for the mixed precipitate of ferric hydrate and alumina
so commonly obtained by chemists in soil analysis. When separated
from the water and dried, the jelly-like substance (“colloidal clay”)
shrinks as extravagantly as would so much boiled starch, into hard,
shiny crusts or flakes, which when struck in mass are sometimes even
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
resonant, and bear more resemblance to glue than to the clay of
everyday life. Like glue, too, but much more quickly and tenaciously,
the dried colloidal clay adheres to the tongue, so as to render the
separation painful; when wetted it quickly bulges with great energy,
and in a short time resumes its former jelly-like condition. When
moistened with less water it assumes a highly plastic and adhesive
condition, so that it is difficult to handle and almost as sure to soil
the operator’s hands as so much pitch.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Effects of Alkali Carbonates upon Clay.</i>—The carbonate of
potash and soda, when in very dilute solution (.01 to .05%) exert
upon diffused clay an effect the reverse of the acids and neutral
salts. They destroy the flocculent aggregates formed by precipitation
with these, or naturally existing in the soil, and tend to puddle the
clay so as to render it impervious to water. It is thus that in the
alkali lands of the arid regions we often find the soil or subsoil
consolidated into a very refractory “hardpan,” difficult to break even
with a sledge hammer and impossible to reduce to tilth until the alkali
carbonate is destroyed by means of a lime salt, such as gypsum. (<a href="#Page_455">See
chapt. 23</a>). Ammonia water also helps to cause the diffusion of clay in
water, but its effect of course disappears upon drying. It is probable
that this property of sodic carbonate can be utilized in rendering
earth dams firmer and more secure against the penetration of water.</p>

<span class="h_subtitle">THE MINOR MINERALINGREDIENTS OF SOILS;<br>
MINERAL FERTILIZERS; MINERALS INJURIOUS<br> TO AGRICULTURE.</span></h3>
</div>

<h4>(A.) MINERALS USED AS FERTILIZERS.</h4>

<p>Of minerals important in soil-formation, not usually present in large
amounts in rocks, but extensively used in fertilization, the following
require mention:</p>

<p><i>Apatite</i>; phosphate of lime containing more or less of the
chlorids and fluorids of the same metal; the mineral from which the
phosphoric acid of the soil is mostly derived. In the crystallized
condition when perfectly pure it is colorless; but it is mostly of a
greenish tint (hence “asparagus stone”). The pure crystalline mineral
rarely occurs in large masses (as in Canada); but small to minute
crystals are found widely disseminated in many rocks (granites,
“basalts” of the Pacific Northwest), thus passing into the soils
formed from these rocks. These crystals are readily recognized,
being regular six-sided prisms with a flat or obtusely pyramidal
termination (distinction from quartz), and do not effervesce with acids
(distinction from calcite). By far the largest deposits of this mineral
occur in connection with carbonate of lime, in the rock materials known
as <i>phosphorites</i>. Lime phosphate being, like the carbonate,
soluble in carbonated water, the two naturally frequently pass into
solution, and are subsequently deposited together. Most limestones
contain a small proportion of lime phosphate, being, as already stated,
formed from the shells and the framework of animal organisms usually
containing also phosphates. But the content of phosphates in limestones
is not readily apparent to the eye, and the richest deposits, save
such as contain animal bones, have long passed unsuspected as to their
being anything else but limestone. Systematic search has now revealed
the presence of phosphate rock in numerous localities, chiefly where
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
limestone formations occur. In the United States, in South Carolina,
Florida, Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky, Nevada; in South America, on
Curaçoa island, Venezuela; in the Antilles on Sombrero, St. Martins
and Navassa islands. In Africa, in Algiers and Tunisia; in Europe, in
Spain (Estremadura, one of the first deposits known), France, Belgium
and the adjacent parts of Germany; in Bohemia and Galicia in Austria;
and very extendedly in European Russia. Many islands of Oceanica supply
phosphorites derived from the decomposition of bird guano by the coral
limestone.</p>

<div class="blockquot fs_90">
<p>Unfortunately the percentage of phosphate in a large proportion of
these materials is not sufficiently high to make their conversion into
water-soluble superphosphate economically possible at the present time;
since all the calcic carbonate present must also be converted into
comparatively worthless sulphate (gypsum) by the use of sulfuric acid;
and as yet no practicable method for avoiding this difficulty has been
found.</p>

<p>“<i>Thomas Slag.</i>”—Probably the nearest approach to such a method
is indicated by the fact that a compound containing four instead of
three molecules of lime to one of P₂O₅, such as is contained in the
“Thomas slag” of the basic process of steel manufacture, is nearly
or in some cases (“sour” soils) <i>quite</i> as effective for the
nutrition of plants as the water-soluble superphosphate. This discovery
has rendered available for agricultural use the phosphoric acid
contained in the enormous deposits of limonite iron ore known as bog
ore, which contains a large proportion of ferric phosphate and from
that cause has until lately been excluded from the manufacture of
wrought iron and steel. It is reasonable to hope that by some analogous
process the low-grade phosphorites, such as those of Nevada and the
plains of Russia, will also in the course of time become available
for agricultural use. Extremely fine grinding and washing (producing
“floats”) has been resorted to for the purpose of rendering the raw
phosphorites effective in fertilization. But while this is successful
on some soils, on others the “floats” remain almost inert; so that this
method has found only limited acceptance.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Animal bones</i>, which consist of from 24 to 30% of animal
substance and 70 to 76% of “bone earth,” (or when fossil are free from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
the former), are largely used for the manufacture of superphosphate.
The bone-earth consists in the main of tri-calcic phosphate with from
one to two per cent of calcium fluorid (much as in natural apatite),
a small amount of magnesic phosphate, and about 4 to 6% of calcic
carbonate. Bone meal can therefore supply to plants both phosphoric
acid and nitrogen, and the presence of the latter has been largely the
cause of a material overestimate of its efficacy as a fertilizer in
the past. Wagner’s and Maerker’s experiments have shown that at least
in sandy soils poor in humus, it cannot be considered an adequate
source of phosphoric acid for annual crops, and that in these soils
its immediate effects are almost wholly due to its nitrogen-content.
The slow availability of the phosphoric acid renders it unprofitable
as a source of the latter, outside of the heavier lands with abundance
of humus; in “sour” lands (notably on meadows) bone meal produces
its best results. In soils naturally calcareous, or in such as have
received heavy dressings of lime either as carbonate or in the caustic
condition, the manurial effects of bone meal are seriously diminished.
Nagaoka (Bull. Coll. Agr. Tokyo, Vol. 6, No. 3) shows that the crop
of rice fertilized with bone meal was reduced to less than half when
limed, and that the phosphoric acid taken up by the crop was reduced to
one-sixth. In any case it is most important that bone meal should be
as finely ground as possible, as in the case of the phosphorites; and
this can best be done when it has first been freed from fats by boiling
with water, and then steamed under pressure. It can then also be most
readily converted into superphosphate.</p>

<p>The phosphate minerals and the fertilizers manufactured therefrom are
of primary importance to agriculture. The phosphoric-acid content of
soils is mostly very small, and only a fraction of it is usually in
an immediately available form. Hence for permanent productiveness,
and especially for intensive farming or gardening, a cheap supply of
phosphate fertilizers is of first importance in all soils and climates.</p>

<p>Other phosphate minerals occur frequently, but as a rule only in
small amounts, in connection with the ores of most metals. The only
ones of these of interest to agriculture are <i>Vivianite</i> and
<i>Dufrenite</i>, the phosphates respectively of the protoxid and
peroxid of iron. The former occurs in mineral deposits
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span> as small blue
crystals, or more frequently as blue earthy masses or streaks, in the
substrata of rich alluvial ground (Louisiana, California). Dufrenite
sometimes results directly from the oxidation of the protoxid mineral,
which then turns greenish and finally brown. Unfortunately these
minerals, rich as they are in phosphoric acid, cannot readily be
utilized as sources of phosphate fertilizers, because of the difficulty
of getting rid of the iron. Their occurrence usually suggests the
presence of abundance of phosphoric acid in the soil. But that which
is actually combined with the iron oxids is practically unavailable
to plants; especially so in the case of the peroxid compound, the
formation of which is a common source of loss of phosphoric acid when
soils rich in iron are submerged for any length of time; a point which
is discussed below (<a href="#Page_234">chapt. 13</a>).</p>

<p>Among the iron phosphate minerals, may also be mentioned “bog ore,”
which results from the reductive maceration of swamped ferruginous
soils, and accumulates in the subsoils and in the bottom of swamps or
moors, forming “moorbedpan”; a dark brown, rather soft mass, which is
sometimes used as an iron ore, especially since the invention of the
“basic process” of iron smelting, one of the products of which is the
phosphate or Thomas slag. (See above).</p>

<p><i>Nitrate of Soda or Chile saltpeter.</i>—This mineral being (like
all nitrates) easily soluble in water, can only occur in regions nearly
or quite destitute of rainfall. Such is the case in the Plateau of
Tarapacà in Northern Chile, where it occurs in large quantities; it
is likewise found, but to much smaller extent, in Nevada, southern
California, Egypt and India. By far its most extended occurrence is
that in Chile, where, together with common salt, it fills cavities and
crevices in a gravelly clay that forms the surface of a plateau from
three to six thousand feet above the sea. It is never pure, but always
mingled with a large proportion (up to 50% and over) of common salt;
also some Glauber’s salt (sulfate of soda) and some sodic perchlorate
and iodid; hence it forms an important commercial source of iodine.</p>

<div class="blockquot fs_90">
<p>The mixed mineral mass, called “Caliche,” when taken out of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
ground is dissolved in water; and the solution boiled down, during
which process the common salt is first deposited and is raked out of
the pans; the nitrate is afterward farther purified by crystallization.
As brought into commerce for agricultural purposes it constitutes a
moist gray saline mass, somewhat resembling common salt, of which
substance it usually contains a few per cent; occasionally also a small
amount of sodic perchlorate (which acts injuriously on vegetation).
Aside from its use as a fertilizer, Chile saltpeter serves for the
manufacture of nitric acid; and either directly, or after previous
transformation into potassic nitrate, for that of gunpowder.</p>

<p>The Chilean locality is the only one from which the commercial
article is derived; the deposits elsewhere are too limited in extent
to compete commercially with the South American product. Caliche
ranging as high as 80% of nitrate of soda has been sent to the writer
from the Colorado Desert in Southern California, but the exact
locality of occurrence has not been divulged. Extended areas of clay
hills impregnated with nitrates exist in the Death Valley region
of California, but in the absence or extreme scarcity of water in
that region, it is doubtful whether these impregnations can be made
practically available. Another locality is that near White Plains,
Nevada, where Caliche averaging about 50% purity is found in cavities
and crevices of a reddish volcanic rock. The rainfall in this region
is so slight that the greater part of the dust or sand blown about
by the wind consists of Glauber’s salt. Here also, as in Chile, the
niter deposits appear to be restricted to within a short distance from
the surface, and the total amount thus far observed appears to be
insufficient to encourage large-scale exploitation.</p>

<p><i>Origin of Nitrate Deposits.</i>—The probable origin of these
niter deposits has given rise to a great deal of discussion, and a wide
difference of opinion exists as to the source from which the nitrogen
may reasonably be supposed to have been derived. According to the
present state of our knowledge, it must be presumed that its sources
have been organic, and that the niter has been produced by the activity
of the same bacteria which now produce nitrates in our soils, rendering
the nitrogen of humus available to plants. But it is by no means clear
what that organic material could have been; for at the present time the
plateau of Tarapacà is almost wholly destitute of vegetation, if not of
animal life. The latest and apparently most reasonable suggestion is
that of <i>Kuntze</i>, who calls attention to the fact that the vicuñas
and llamas which are at home in this portion of the Andes, and are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
known to have roamed over that region in countless herds, have the
curious habit of always depositing their manure in one and the same
place whenever at liberty. Each herd of these animals has its definite
dunging place at some convenient point. That such herds have existed in
the region from time immemorial is obvious from historical as well as
collateral evidence; and as their manure accumulated, its nitrification
would progress rapidly under the prevailing arid conditions. The common
salt would naturally be derived from the urine and excrements, and
the alkaline salts which exist throughout this region as the products
of soil decomposition, would be quite sufficient to account for the
alkaline bases in the caliche. On the other hand, the presence of
iodine points to seaweeds as the organic source.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Intensity of Nitrification in Arid Climates.</i>—Of the efficacy
of nitrification under arid conditions abundant evidence may be found
within the State of California. In the alkali lands of southern
California the nitrates of soda, lime and magnesia are almost
universally present; they form at times as much as one-fifth and even
more of the entire mass of alkali salts, and in one case the total
amount in the soil has been found to reach two tons per acre, with an
average of twelve hundred pounds over ten acres. In the plains of the
San Joaquin Valley, spots strongly impregnated with niter are found,
especially under the shadows of isolated oak trees, where the cattle
have been in the habit of congregating for a long time; a case quite
analogous to that supposed by <i>Kuntze</i> to exist in the Chilean
locality. Of course it is only in arid climates that the accumulation
of nitrates can usually occur; for in the region of summer rains the
nitrates formed during the warm season will inevitably be washed into
the subdrainage, unless restrained by absorption by the roots of
vegetation. The heavy losses occasionally occurring from this cause in
the course of a rainy winter on summer-fallowed land have been amply
demonstrated by many investigations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Potash Minerals.</span>—By far the most abundant
occurrence of potash in the earth’s crust is that in silicates and notably
in orthoclase or potash feldspar, which contributes so largely to
soil-formation. But in the absence of any economically successful
artificial method for producing potash compounds from feldspars on a
commercial scale, almost the entire supply of potash salts was, until
a comparatively late period, derived from plant ashes, viz., the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
“potashes” of commerce. At the same time, almost the entire demand for
alkalies for industrial uses bore upon the same product, until the
invention, toward the end of the last century, of <i>LeBlanc’s</i>
process for the manufacture of soda from common salt; for until that
time, soda in the various forms in which it was imported from the
Orient or prepared from seaweed ashes, was a comparatively costly
product. LeBlanc’s invention was most timely in that it very quickly
diminished materially the production of potashes which, in view of the
increased demand for alkalies for industrial uses, seriously threatened
the depletion of agricultural lands, and of woodlands as well, of one
of its most essential ingredients. Yet as there are many industrial
uses in which soda cannot replace potash, the manufacture of potashes
continued to a greater or less extent, as no other available source
except the ashes of land plants, was then known. The production of
potassic chlorid from the mother-waters of sea salt in the spontaneous
evaporation of sea water for the manufacture of common salt, was on too
small a scale to influence materially the manufacture of potashes.</p>

<p><i>Discovery of Stassfurt Salts.</i>—The depletion of potash had
become so serious a matter in the agricultural lands of Europe,
that for a time much research was bestowed, and prizes offered for
an economical method of producing potash salts from feldspar, on a
commercial scale. But the problem had not been satisfactory solved
when, in the year 1860, attention was called to the fact that the
saline deposits overlying certain large rock-salt beds that had been
developed by borings near Stassfurt in Prussia, contained so large
a proportion of potash salts, as to render their purification and
conversion into fairly pure sulphate and chlorid technically feasible.
The impulse having been given, the potash industry developed rapidly in
that region as well as in the adjacent portions of Saxony, where the
same formation underlies; the production of “Stassfurt Salts” rapidly
assumed a greater development than that of the rock-salt which had
originally prompted the enterprise, and numerous additional boreholes
demonstrated an unexpectedly wide extension of the same beds. At the
present time, in consequence of such development, the manufacture
of potashes from plant ash has almost ceased, outside of Canada and
Hungary; and the production of potash salts in the Stassfurt region now
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
supplies the demand of the entire world, both for industrial and
agricultural purposes.</p>

<p>The cheapening of potash as a fertilizer has rendered possible the
profitable cultivation of large areas of land which were naturally
too poor in that substance for ordinary cultures; and has likewise
rendered possible the restoration to general culture of lands that
had ceased to produce adequately, on account of the depletion caused
by long-continued cropping. It has likewise served to intensify
agricultural production wherever desired; and between this supply and
that of phosphoric acid from the phosphorites (see above), and the
discovery of the nitrogen-absorbing power of leguminous plants, which
can be used for green-manuring, farmers have been enabled to dispense,
in many regions, with the production and use of stable-manure, which
until then had been considered an indispensable adjunct to agriculture
everywhere. Even within the last fifty years it was proclaimed by high
authority in Germany that stable-manure constituted, as it were, the
farmer’s raw material, from which he manufactured the various products
of the field through the intervention of the plant-producing power of
the soil.</p>

<div class="blockquot fs_90">
<p><i>Origin of the Potash Deposits.</i>—The manner in which this
accumulation of potash salts has been formed deserves explanation. It
is abundantly evident that nearly all deposits of rock-salt thus far
known have been formed by the evaporation of sea-water at times when
bays or arms of the sea were cut off from open communication with
the ocean. The composition of sea-water has already been given and
discussed (<a href="#Page_26">chap. 2, p. 26</a>); and by the slow evaporation
of sea-water on a small scale we can quite successfully imitate the phenomena
observed in natural rock-salt deposits. When sea-water is heated
a slight deposit of lime carbonate (usually containing a little
ferric oxid and silica) is soon formed; and a corresponding thin
deposit of ferruginous limestone is commonly found at the base of
rock-salt-bearing deposits. Next above this we almost invariably find
a deposit of gypsum, sometimes of great thickness; in the artificial
evaporation of sea-water the same thing occurs so soon as the brine has
reached a certain degree of concentration. It constitutes the major
portion of the “panstone” of salt-boilers. Next above follows a deposit
of rock-salt, at base somewhat mixed with gypsum; its thickness varies
greatly according to circumstances. Above it lie the potash salts.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span></p>

<p>In the manufacture of sea-salt by evaporation in shore lagoons or
“saltpans,” the solution remaining after the salt has been deposited
(known as “mother-waters,” or “bittern”), of course remains on the
surface of the salt unless allowed to drain off, as is done in the
process of manufacture. When not drained off, the water gradually
evaporates, and there remains a saline crust of a composition exactly
resembling that of the upper layers at Stassfurt, containing a large
proportion of potash salts.</p>

<p>If it be asked why the Stassfurt salts are not found overlying
every rock-salt deposit in the world, the answer is that in a great
many cases the concentrated mother-waters have had an opportunity to
flow off from the surface of the rock-salt by the action of tides,
the inflow of fresh water from the land or from other causes. Their
presence therefore depends upon the fulfilment of accidental conditions
not nearly always realized in the natural evaporation of sea-water, but
which happened to occur on a very large scale in that portion of the
North-European continent.</p>

<p><i>Nature of the Salts.</i>—The potash is present in the Stassfurt
salts in the form of complex sulfates and chlorids containing, besides,
sodium, calcium and magnesium in various proportions and modes of
combination. The most abundant of the potassic chlorid minerals is
carnallite, a hydrous chlorid of potassium and magnesium. The chlorids
characterize chiefly the upper portions of the deposit, the sulfates
the lower.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Kainit.</i>—Of the products derived from the Stassfurt salt
industry for agricultural use, the two requiring special consideration
are “kainit,” a natural mixture of the several chlorid minerals
in varying proportions; and “high-grade sulfate.” Being a natural
product, “kainit” is the cheapest source of potash available to the
farmer; but on account of its variability in composition it must
be sold and purchased on guaranteed assay. On account of its large
content of chlorin it is not desirable in the production of certain
crops, especially in the arid region, where alkali soils, and even
those not visibly alkaline, often contain already large amounts of
chlorin. Moreover, kainit usually contains a considerable proportion
of common salt. For the arid region therefore the sulfate is generally
preferable, although it is somewhat higher in price for the same amount
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
of potash. The potash content of commercial kainit (calculated as K₂O)
ranges from 16 to 35%, while the sulphate frequently ranges from 80 up
to 95% of the pure sulfate; thus costing materially less in freight
charges than the lower-grade kainit. Its potash content ranges from 43
to over 50% of K₂O.</p>

<p><i>Potash Salts in Alkali Soils.</i>—The sulfates and chlorids of
potassium, however, occur not only in connection with rock-salt
deposits, but are also found in the alkali soils of the arid region.
They are, in fact, never absent where such salts occur at all, and
their percentage in the total of salts ranges all the way from about
4 to as much as 20% of potash sulphate. In numerous cases it has been
found that the content of this salt to the depth of four feet amounts
to from 1200 to 1500 pounds per acre. In such lands, of course,
additional fertilization with potash salts is totally uncalled for,
the more as such soils invariably contain, besides the water-soluble
potash, an unusually large percentage of the same in the form of easily
decomposable silicates, or zeolites.</p>

<p><i>Farmyard or Stable Manure.</i>—In connection with the subject of
mineral fertilizers, it will be proper to discuss briefly the uses and
special merits of stable manure, composts, etc. Up to within the last
century, these were practically the only fertilizers known and used,
and the exclusive use of this manure might have continued indefinitely
but for the discovery that as time progressed, stable manure and with
it grain crops, for the production of which it was necessary, became
less and less in amount, so as to threaten bread famines. The cause of
this diminution was, of course, the incompleteness of the return of the
soil-ingredients taken off by the crops, when these were exported to
feed the cities or foreign countries. Thus the attention of chemists,
and notably that of Liebig, was attracted to the solution of the
problem of keeping up production even with an insufficient supply of
stable manure; and the discovery of the use of mineral fertilizers was
the result of their activity.</p>

<p>The chemical composition of stable manure does not, alone, suffice to
explain its remarkable efficacy and the difficulty of replacing it
by any other material. The composition of manure of course differs
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
not only with different animals but also with the different feeds
consumed by them; but the average composition of farmyard manure is
approximately given thus by Wolff and others:</p>

<p>It is thus seen that the percentage of the important plant-foods in
stable manure are minute when compared with those commonly found in
“commercial” fertilizers. Nor are they so much more available for plant
absorption than the latter; a very large proportion is not utilized
at all the first year, and unless the amount applied is very large it
hardly carries the supply needed for the usual crops.</p>

<p>It is now well understood that its efficacy is largely due to the
important physical effects it produces in the soil. It helps directly
to render heavy clay soils more loose and readily tillable. If well
“rotted” or cured it also serves to render sandy, leachy soils more
retentive of moisture; and the humus formed in its progressive decay
imparts to all soils the highly important qualities discussed later on
(<a href="#Page_120">chapt. 8</a>). More than this, the later researches have shown
that stable manure acts perhaps most immediately upon the bacterial activity in the
soil, greatly increasing it not only directly by the vast numbers of
these organisms it brings with it, but also in supplying appropriate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
food for those normally existing in the soil (<a href="#Page_142">see chapt. 9</a>).
In so doing it serves indirectly to render the soil ingredients more
available, and to impart to the soil the loose condition required
in a good seed-bed—a “tilth” which cannot be brought about by the
operations of tillage alone.</p>

<p>The only possible substitute for the use of stable manure is found
in green-manuring with leguminous crops conjointly with the use of
commercial or mineral fertilizers. Unless this is done the use of the
latter, alone, ultimately leads to a depletion of humus substances,
which renders the acquisition of proper tilth by the seed-bed
impossible, and causes a compacting of the surface soil which no
tillage can remedy.</p>

<p><i>Proper method of using stable manure in humid and arid
climates.</i>—In the humid region it is a common practice to spread
the stable manure on the surface of the fields and leave it there
without any special operation to put it into the soil; trusting to
the rains, earthworms and subsequent tillage for its being brought
into adequate contact with the roots; it is rarely plowed in. In the
arid region this mode of using it is impracticable; it would remain
on the surface indefinitely without advancing in its decay because
of the dryness, and unless plowed in very deep the ordinary, strawy
manure would ruin the seed-bed by rendering it too pervious to the
dry air, thus preventing germination. Much of this valuable material
has therefore been, and to some extent is still being burnt, thus
causing a severe depletion of the land, both of humus and of mineral
plant-food. The best way to deal with stable manure in the arid regions
is to thoroughly rot or cure it before putting it on the land, and
then plowing it in. To do this of course it must be put in piles
and wetted regularly; a procedure which at the high prices of labor
is thought to be too expensive, but which in the end would be found
eminently profitable, unless green-manuring is regularly done. The
very small proportion of humus generally present in arid soils renders
this precaution indispensable, if production and proper tilth is to be
maintained. The saving of stable manure and of all composting material,
even if less needful as a means of supplying plant-food in the rich
soils of the arid regions, is fully as essential in order to maintain
the humus supply.

<h4>(B.) MINERALS UNESSENTIAL OR<br> INJURIOUS TO SOILS.</h4>

<p>The minerals heretofore mentioned contribute to soil formation
either one or several ingredients, important to plant growth
either by their mechanical or chemical action. It remains to
consider some not intrinsically desirable, but frequently present
in certain soils, which should be known to the farmer in
order that he may be enabled to counteract or remove their
injurious effects. Leaving aside such as are of only casual or
rare occurrence, the following may be mentioned as among
those which not unfrequently affect soils desirable for culture
to such extent as to make them unavailable for general farming
purposes:</p>

<p><i>Iron Pyrite</i>; sulphid of iron containing two molecules of
sulphur to one of iron; a mineral exceedingly common in deposits of
metallic ores, and whose deceptive gold-like color has caused it to be
mistaken for gold so often as to cause it to be designated as “fool’s
gold” among miners. While it frequently does contain some gold and is
often associated with valuable ores, it is practically valueless when
occurring outside of mineral veins, in rock-masses; and more especially
in sedimentary rocks, such as sandstones, limestones, shales and clays.</p>

<p>When present in soils it sometimes becomes a source of trouble to
the farmer, because in contact with air it is soon transformed into
ferrous sulfate or copperas, which, like the carbonate referred to
above, is injurious to plants. Sometimes indeed iron pyrite is actually
<i>formed</i> in badly-drained soils alongside of the carbonate of
iron, when much sulfate (such as gypsum) is present; and then its
injurious effects subside more slowly than do those of the carbonate
(<a href="#Page_46">see above, p. 46</a>).</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90"><i>Recognition of Iron pyrite.</i>—The
mineral is easily recognized by its golden or brass-yellow tint; the
latter color being the one most commonly shown in the “sulphur balls”
occurring in marls or soft limestones. A very easy test is to pulverize
it and then heat it on a shovel over a fire, when it will soon itself
take fire, burning with a blue sulphur flame, and upon more complete
roasting, leaving behind a red powder, viz., “Venetian red” or red
ochre; that is, ferric oxid. In clays it commonly occurs in large,
well-defined cubes, which do not readily form copperas but rather
become covered with a crust of limonite or brown iron ore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
When a subsoil is found to contain pyrite, or when “sulfur balls”
have been accidentally introduced with dressings of marl, the remedy
is thorough and persistent aeration of the material. In the case of
marls nothing more need be done; but in that of ill-drained subsoils
it is best to add lime in moderate dressings, to accelerate the
transformation into ferric hydrate or iron rust, and gypsum; whereby
the copperas becomes not only innocuous but adds two beneficial
ingredients to the soil. The same policy will render available manure
or other materials which have been disinfected by means of solution of
copperas.</p>

<p><i>Halite</i> (rock-salt), or common salt, has already been mentioned
as to its occurrence in connection with the Stassfurt potash salts
(see above, page 71); but as rock-salt it rarely exerts any injurious
influence upon lands. It is, however, a common ingredient of seashore
lands, and is also present to a certain extent in the alkali lands
of the arid countries. While it is true that occasionally small
quantities of common salt are used as an ingredient in fertilization,
its usefulness in that direction is exceedingly subordinate; and it
is far more generally to be considered as an injurious ingredient of
all cultivatable soils whenever present to a larger extent than a few
hundredths of one per cent It is usually considered that one-fourth
of one per cent of common salt renders lands unfit for most culture
plants. Only a few, such as asparagus, the beet, the saltbushes and
some others, succeed when it is present in this or in larger amounts.
In the case of sea water it is usually accompanied by a still more
injurious ingredient, magnesic chlorid or bittern; which is detrimental
to plant growth in much smaller quantities than the common salt itself.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90"><i>Recognition of Common Salt.</i>—The
presence of common salt may, as a rule, be detected by the taste,
well-known to every one; when this taste is very intense or somewhat
bitterish, it indicates the presence of bittern. The presence of salt,
however, is easily verified without the use of chemical reagents, by
slowly evaporating some of the clear water leached from the soil in
a clean silver spoon. If the last few drops are allowed to evaporate
spontaneously, it will be easy to distinguish, even with the unaided
eye, the square, cubical crystals, sometimes combined into cross-shape,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
which are characteristic of common salt. It is always an unwelcome
addition to the land, and as its action cannot be neutralized in any
way, it can be gotten rid of only by leaching-out. This process is
usually accomplished in seashore lands by the action of rain, or by
the overflow of fresh-water streams, after the tide has been excluded
by means of drains provided with check-valves to prevent the inflow of
tidewater; or else by underdrainage, and flooding when possible.</p>

<p><i>Mirabilite</i>, (Glauber’s salt) or sulfate of soda, exists not
unfrequently in the soils of the arid region and sometimes encrusts
extended areas of lowlands during the dry season. When present in the
soil it will commonly be seen blooming out on the surface after a rain,
in light, feathery, needle-shaped crystals, sometimes to such an extent
that it can be collected by the handful. Subsequently, when wafted
by the wind, it is reduced to a fine white dust, which constitutes a
goodly proportion and sometimes the entire mass of the “alkali dust”
that is so annoying on the plains of Nevada, and in the desert regions
generally, during the hot summer. Near White Plains, Nevada, it forms a
thick layer of “<i>white sand</i>,” in which the foot sinks deeply, and
which is carried about by the wind with great ease.</p>

<p>Glauber’s salt is never a desirable soil-ingredient. It is largely
produced as a by-product in several industries, but cannot be utilized
for agricultural purposes to any extent. It is, however, much less
injurious to plant growth than common salt; according to experience
in California it may be considered about three times less so. It
constitutes the major portion of what is commonly known as “white
alkali,” which is well known to be much less injurious to crops than
the “black” kind, which contains carbonate of soda.</p>

<p><i>Trona and Urao</i> are natural forms of carbonate of soda or
salsoda. Like Glauber’s salt, it commonly occurs as a surface
efflorescence or crust in dry or desert regions; either from the
evaporation of standing water, as in the case of the soda lakes of
Nevada, Hungary and Egypt, or as an efflorescence on the surface of the
soil, as in the western United States, Mexico (“urao”), North Africa
(“trona”), and at many points in the Old Continent. In the United
States it is commonly known as “black alkali,” because of the black
spots formed on the surface by evaporation; practically the same name
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
(“kara”) is given it in Arabia and Asia Minor, whence impure soda
has long been imported into Europe; while in north India it forms
part of the “reh” salts that incrust large areas (usar lands) in the
Indo-Gangetic plain.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">The natural mineral always contains
an excess of carbonic acid over the “normal” salt, nearly in the
proportion of four parts of carbonic dioxid to three of soda; it is
sometimes designated as sesqui-carbonate. In hot sunshine it may lose
most of this excess for a time; while within the soil itself it may, in
presence of abundant carbonic acid, become temporarily converted wholly
into hydrocarbonate or “bicarbonate,” which is less corrosive than the
monocarbonate or common salsoda.</p>

<p><i>Injury caused in soils.</i>—Like common and Glauber’s salt,
carbonate of soda is always an unwelcome soil ingredient; more so, in
fact, than either of the other two, since less than a tenth of one per
cent is sufficient to render certain soils wholly untillable, by the
deflocculation or puddling of the clay; at the same time rendering it
impervious to water. It is by far the most injurious ingredient that
ordinarily occurs in otherwise good, arable soils; for in addition to
the physical effect just mentioned, it dissolves the humus-substance
of the soil, forming an inky-black solution which, especially when
evaporating on the surface and forming black spots, has given rise to
the popular name of “black alkali.” As will be more fully explained
hereafter, wherever such is the case, the first step necessary toward
reclamation is the transformation of the carbonate of soda, at least in
part, into the relatively innocuous sulfate, by means of gypsum in the
presence of water; while carbonate of lime remains in the soil.</p>

<p>In its direct action on the plants themselves, soda is also most
injurious; as when accumulated to any extent near the surface by
evaporation it will corrode the root-crown or stem, and sometimes
completely girdle the same, destroying the bark. Farther details on
this subject are given in <a href="#Page_422">chapter 22</a>.</p>

<p><i>Epsomite</i>, or Epsom salt, or sulfate of magnesia, is another one
of the water-soluble minerals frequently found efflorescent on the
surface of the ground; more commonly in saline seashore lands than in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
the alkali region proper, although it is rather common in the
northeastern portion of the arid region of the United States. Whether
on the soil surface or in the crevices of rocks, its needle-shaped,
feathery crystals greatly resemble those of Glauber’s salt, but are
readily distinguished by the more intensely bitter taste. Epsom salt
is frequently the last remnant of sea-salts left in the soil after
reclamation. Though probably somewhat more injurious to plant growth
than Glauber’s salt, the mineral Kieserite, one of the Stassfurt
salts and consisting essentially of Epsom salt, is sometimes used as
an application to calcareous lands instead of gypsum, and with good
results. Yet gypsum is usually the safer, and equally effective.</p>

<p><i>Borax</i> (bi-borate of soda) occurs much more rarely than the salts
just described; most frequently in certain portions of California,
forming part of the “alkali” in the soil. It is injurious to plant
growth, but is as readily dealt with as is the carbonate of soda, by
dressings of gypsum, whereby inert borate of lime is produced.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to say that saline waters containing any of
the above salts in notable amounts must be used for irrigation very
cautiously. The measures to be observed in this respect will be
discussed later.

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle">PHYSICAL COMPOSITION OF THE SOILS.</span></h3>

<p>As has already been stated (<a href="#Page_10">chapt. 1, p. 10</a>), the general
physical constituents of soils are <i>rock powder or sand</i> and <i>silt</i>,
more or less decomposed according to the nature of the original rocks;
<i>clay</i>, the product of the decomposition of feldspars and some
other silicates; <i>humus</i>, the complex product of the decomposition
of vegetable and animal matters on and in the soil mass; as well as
vegetable matter not yet humified. Each of these several constituents
must now be considered more in detail. Since clay is the substance
whose functions and quantitative proportions influence most strikingly
the agricultural qualities of land, it should be first discussed.</p>

<h4><i>Clay as a Soil Ingredient.</i></h4>

<p>The plasticity and adhesiveness of clay, together with the extreme
fineness of its ultimate particles (said to reach the 1-25000 of an
inch), explains its great importance as a physical soil ingredient.
It serves to hold together and impart stability to the flocculent
aggregates of soil particles that compose a well-tilled soil; for
without clay the sand would collapse into close-packed single grains
so soon as dried, and loose tilth would be impossible. Sand drifts
illustrate this condition.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the fineness of the particles serves to render clay
very retentive of moisture as well as of gases and of solids dissolved
in water, imparting these important properties to soils containing it;
while coarse sandy soils are oftentimes so deficient in them as to
render them unadapted to any useful culture, despite the presence of an
adequate supply of plant-food.</p>

<p>When to these essential physical properties of clay, there is added the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
fact that usually the clay-substance as it exists in soils contains the
most finely pulverized and most highly decomposed portions of the other
soil-minerals, and therefore the main part of the available mineral
plant-food, it is easy to understand why soils containing a good supply
of clay should be called and considered “strong” land by the farmers
of all countries. “Poor” clay soils are exceptional; but sometimes the
clay content reaches such a figure that the difficulties of tillage
render them too uncertain of production for profitable occupation.</p>

<p><i>Amount of Colloidal Clay in Soils.</i>—Any and all of the kinds of
clay mentioned (<a href="#Page_57">p. 57</a>) as occurring naturally may, of course,
enter into and form part of soils. But as the amount of true, plastic clay
substance contained in them is very indefinite, it becomes necessary,
in order to classify soils in respect to their tillableness, to
ascertain more definitely the amount of pure, or nearly pure, colloidal
clay substance contained in the several classes of soils ordinarily
recognized and mentioned in farming practice. That this determination
can at best be only approximate, is obvious from the fact mentioned
above (<a href="#Page_59">chapt. 4, p. 59</a>), that pure kaolinite itself is
not plastic, and only becomes so by the indefinite comminution and hydration it
experiences in the processes of soil-formation. As the progress of this
process is also indefinite, the same soil containing particles ranging
from the finest to the chalky scales of pure kaolinite, the drawing of
a line must be more or less arbitrary and empirical.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">From numerous experiments and comparisons
made, the writer has been led to place the limits of “plastic clay” at
and below such grain sizes as will remain suspended (afloat) in a water
column eight inches high, during 24 hours. To go beyond this point in
the examination of soils for practical purposes, would render such
examinations so laborious and hence so rare, that this kind of work
would be practically excluded from ordinary practice. According to this
view the following percentages of such “clay” correspond approximately
to the designations placed opposite:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span></p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">It must be distinctly understood, however,
that these figures make no claim to accuracy or invariability. For,
the tilling qualities of a soil containing one and the same amount of
such “clay” may be very materially modified according to the kind and
amount of each of the several grain-sizes of rock powder or sand they
contain.</p>

<p><i>Influence of fine powders on plasticity and adhesiveness.</i>—An
admixture of a large amount of fine powders diminishes materially the
adhesiveness of a clay soil, even though it may render it even more
“heavy” in tillage; while the admixture of coarse sand, even in very
considerable proportions, does not greatly influence the adhesiveness
of the clay. The latter alone cannot therefore serve as a proper guide
or basis for the classification of soils in respect to tillage; we
must also take into consideration the nature and amount of the several
granular sediments mixed with it.</p>

<p>Moreover, the nature and especially the adhesiveness of the clay
substance as obtained by analysis may vary considerably in the presence
of a very large amount of the finest grain-sizes; among which ferric
hydrate or iron rust is especially apt to accumulate predominantly
in the clay, considerably increasing its apparent weight and greatly
diminishing its adhesiveness.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
In strongly ferruginous soils, therefore, it becomes necessary to take
into special consideration the amount of the ferric hydrate or rust
which accumulates in the clay substance. The presence of large amounts
of humus or vegetable mold also influences materially the adhesiveness
and physical properties of the clay obtained by the method described,
although most of it remains with the finer powdery sediments or
grain-sizes. There are, besides, other colloidal or at least amorphous
substances present in all soils, such as silicic, aluminic and zeolitic
hydrates, which are all non-plastic, and yet sufficiently fine to form
part of the “clay” obtained as above specified.</p>

<p>Despite these imperfections, (which however can in a measure be
taken into consideration in judging of a soil’s tilling qualities by
its clay content), the figures given in the above table approximate
much more nearly to a tangible basis for such estimate, than the
utterly indefinite mixtures which under the older methods of analysis
have been, and still are to some extent, used as a basis for soil
classification by writers on agriculture.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span></p>

<h4><i>Rock Powder; Sand, Silt and Dust.</i></h4>

<p>The powdery (sandy and silty) constituents of soils usually constitute
the greater part of their mass; and the proportions present of the
several grades of fineness exert a most decisive influence upon their
cultural qualities, and very commonly upon their agricultural value
also. It is needless to add that the kind of mineral of which they
consist or from which they were formed, is also of great importance in
determining the quality of soils from the standpoint of the chemist,
with respect to their content of mineral plant-food.</p>

<h4>WEATHERING IN HUMID AND<br> ARID REGIONS.</h4>

<p><i>Sands of the Humid Regions.</i>—As has already been stated, “sand”
is usually understood to be, in the main, quartz more or less finely
pulverized, generally intermingled with a few grains of other minerals.
With this understanding, since quartz is practically inert with respect
to plant nutrition, it follows that soils consisting mainly of this
substance contain but little plant-food; hence the common expression
“poor, sandy land,” the outcome of the experience had in Europe and
in the Eastern United States, and which until recently has been held
to be of general application. The “sands of the desert” have, both in
ordinary life and in poetry, always stood as the symbol of sterility.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">Thus the sandy lands (“sand hammocks”) of
Florida, the (long-leaf) pine lands of the Gulf States, the “pine
barrens” of New Jersey and of Michigan, are noted both for their sandy
soils and their sterility after brief cultivation; necessitating
fertilization within a few years from the time of occupation. In
Europe, the “Heide” (heather) soils of northeastern Germany are of the
same cultural character.</p>

<p><i>Sands of the Arid Regions.</i>—The experience of arid countries
however, has long ago shown that some very sandy lands—<i>e. g.</i>,
such as form the oases of the north African deserts—may be extremely
productive when irrigated, and also of considerable durability.
Actual experience and close investigation given this subject in the
arid regions of the United States has fully demonstrated that lands
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
appearing to the casual observer to be hopelessly sterile sandy
deserts, very commonly prove to be even more productive than the more
clayey lands of the same regions. Examination of the sand shows, in
these cases, that instead of mere grains of quartz, the minerals
of the parent rock, partially decomposed, themselves constitute a
large proportion of the sandy mass. But in the regions of deficient
rainfall, as has already been stated, (<a href="#Page_47">p. 47</a>) the formation
of clay (kaolinization) is exceedingly slow; hence the decomposition of the
rock powder results in the production of predominantly pulverulent
instead of clayey soils. But the mineral plant-food is not on that
account less available, provided other physical conditions necessary
for the success of plant growth are fulfilled. Among these moisture
stands foremost; hence the relative proportions of the several
grain-sizes are of vital importance, since upon this depends to a great
extent the proper supply and distribution of moisture, without which no
amount of plant-food will avail. Moreover, the finest and most highly
decomposed powder is the portion from which the roots draw their chief
food-supplies.</p>

<div class="blockquot fs_90">
<p>The point last mentioned is well shown in the results obtained
by Dr. R. H. Loughridge, from the analysis of each of the several
grain-sizes into which he had resolved a very generalized soil of the
State of Mississippi, representing a very large land area in that
State as well as in Tennessee and Louisiana. The details of this
investigation are given farther on; but summarily it may be stated that
he found practically the whole of the acid-soluble mineral plant-food
accumulated within the portion of the soil the fineness of whose grains
was below .025 millimeters (one-thousandth of an inch); ingredients
so fine as to be wholly impalpable between the fingers. Moreover,
two-thirds of the total amount was found in the portion described above
as “clay.” It is thus readily understood why clay soils are in the
regions of summer rains commonly designated as “strong” lands.</p>

<p>The corresponding later investigations of Rudzinski (Ann. Agr. Inst.
Moscow, Vol. 9, No. 2, pp. 172-234; Exp. Sta. Record, Dec. 1904, p.
245) and of Mazurenko (Jour. Exp. Landw. 1904, pp. 73-75; Exp’t Stn.
Record, Dec. 1904, p. 344) fully corroborate Loughridge’s conclusions,
for typical soils of European Russia.</p>
</div>

<p>In the arid or irrigation regions, however, the case is different, for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
the reason that much of the decomposed rock-substance remains adherent
to the surface of the larger grains, and plastic clay is formed to a
much less extent. Much available plant-food may therefore, in arid
lands, be present even in rather coarsely sandy soils almost devoid
of clay; such as in humid climates would be likely to be found wholly
barren. (<a href="#Page_340">See chapt. 19</a>).</p>

<h4>PHYSICAL ANALYSIS OF SOILS.</h4>

<p><i>Use of Sieves.</i>—Down to a certain point the separation of the
soil into its several grain-sizes may be accomplished by means of
sieves. We may thus separate coarse gravel from fine gravel and from
sand; and the latter may itself be separated into several sizes by
the same means. This presupposes, of course, that the soil has been
previously prepared for the purpose by crushing the lumps consisting
of aggregates of finer particles, that in the operation of tillage
would again be resolved into their fine constituents, or be penetrated
by roots. But this preparation of the soil for sifting must not be
carried beyond the point mentioned, for a grain consisting of particles
somewhat firmly cemented together will under ordinary conditions play
in the soil precisely the same part as a solid sand-grain, and must not
therefore be broken up, if the soil is to be examined in its natural
condition. The pressure of the fingers or of a rubber pestle is as
far as trituration should go. The disintegration of these compound
particles by means of acids, as prescribed and practiced by the French
soil chemists, may wholly change the physical nature of the soil by
the breaking-up of mechanical aggregations which in the usual course
of tillage would remain intact. This is especially true of strongly
calcareous soils, and particularly those containing calcareous sand.</p>

<div class="blockquot fs_90">
<p>The sieves used for this purpose should not be ordinary wire sieves,
but should have bottoms of sheet brass perforated by <i>round</i> holes
of the various diameters desired, of fractions of inches, or preferably
of millimeters. For the finer grain sizes, silk bolting cloth is used
by the U. S. Bureau of Soils.</p>

<p>In the sifting process it will be found that so soon as the finer
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
grain-sizes of the sand are approached, the sieve fails to act
satisfactorily; the more so, the more clay was originally contained
in the material. The fine particles flock together, forming little
pellets, which refuse to be separated by the sieve. This difficulty
can, of course, be partly overcome by previously separating the clay
from the sand by means of water, as detailed above; but even then it
will be found that so soon as the grain-sizes fall much below ¹/₅₀
of an inch (½ millimeter) the same difficulty is experienced, so
long as the sand is dry. By playing a small stream of water upon the
sieve, however, all the particles beyond the ¹/₅₀₀ of an inch may be
successfully separated from the coarser portion; and for many practical
purposes the separation need be carried no farther.</p>

<p><i>Use of Water for Separating Finest Grain-Sizes.</i>—The
scientific investigator, however, must of necessity proceed to separate
the finer grain-sizes from each other, since, as will presently be
shown, they influence the tilling qualities of the soil to a much
greater degree than do the coarser particles. Such farther separation
can be accomplished only by the aid of water.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Subsidence Method.</i>—When a small amount of soil is stirred
up in water, and is afterward allowed to stand for some time, the
different grain-sizes will settle consecutively in accordance with
their sizes (or weights); the smallest ones settling latest, and the
clay only remaining suspended, as stated above. So long, however, as
any considerable amount remains suspended in the water, the latter
is not only denser but especially more viscid than if the clay were
absent. In order therefore to obtain correct results by any method
involving the use of water, it is necessary to remove the clay before
proceeding to the separation of the granular sediments. This, as has
been already stated, is approximately accomplished by allowing the
soil, when diffused in water after proper disintegration, to settle for
24 hours from a column of water 200 mm. high, whereby all grain-sizes,
of and above .01 mm. diameter are removed from the turbid liquid. This
sedimentation is then repeated until after 24 hours the water becomes
clear. The clay is then determined in the “clay water” by evaporation
or precipitation; the granular sediments may then be successfully
separated by sedimentation.</p>

<p>The U. S. Bureau of Soils uses for the separation of clay, instead of
subsidence for 24 hours, the more expeditious process of centrifuging
the turbid soil water in appropriate glass cylinders, by the aid of an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
electric motor; and thus in a relatively short time obtains “clay” in
which the upper limit of size is one-half of that mentioned above,
viz., .005 mm. But for the costliness of the appliances required,
including the entire time of an operator, this method of separating the
clay would undoubtedly be preferable to the elimination by subsidence;
the more as a more minute grain-size for the clay group is thus secured.</p>

    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 6.</span>—<br>Schöne’s<br> Elutriator.</p>
</div>

<p>The separation of the clay having been accomplished, the various sizes
of silt and sand may be separated by again suspending them in water;
and interrupting the settling process at stated times, the grain-sizes
corresponding to definite velocities in settling may be segregated and
weighed. When this process of settling and decanting is carefully and
repeatedly carried out, very good results are obtained.</p>

<p><i>Hydraulic Elutriation.</i>—The sedimentation (or “beaker”) method,
long practiced in the arts is, however, quite tedious, requiring the
constant close attention of a skilled observer. The desired results
may, in the writer’s judgment, be more conveniently obtained by the
hydraulic method, whenever no very large volume of work of this kind is
required to be done at once.</p>

<p>When instead of allowing the soil to settle in quiet water, the latter
is used as an ascending current of regularly graded velocities, it
is clear that the soil particles will be carried off by this current
in exact conformity with their several sizes (or strictly speaking,
volume-weights); and when maintained in such a current for a sufficient
length of time, the entire quantity of the sediment corresponding to
the prevailing velocity will be carried away. It is of course easy
to ascertain to what grain-sizes certain velocities of the upward
current (regulated by a stopcock with arm moving on a graduated scale)
correspond, and to regulate accordingly the intervals between the
different velocities to greater or less detail, as may be desired. A
number of instruments have been devised for this purpose.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span></p>

<p><i>Schöne’s Elutriator</i> is the one commonly used in Europe; in it
the upward current ascends in a conical glass tube, (<a href="#FIG_6">see figure 6</a>)
entering through a narrow, curved inlet tube, in which the soil sample
is kept agitated by the current itself. The objection to this plan is
twofold: first, the narrow, curved inlet-tube is readily clogged by the
soil mass at the lower velocities, which are thereby changed, so that,
unless a very small amount of soil only is employed, the whole mass is
not kept properly stirred; second, the circulating currents brought
about by the conical shape of the tube cause the sediment-particles to
coalesce into complex, larger ones (floccules), which will then settle
down and fail to pass over at the current-velocity corresponding to
their individual component parts.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 7.</span>—The Churn Elutriator
        (Hilgard’s)<br> for the physical analysis of soils.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Churn Elutriator with Cylindrical Tube.</i>—The errors just alluded
to are obviated by an arrangement devised by the writer, in which a
rapidly revolving stirrer, placed at the base of a cylindrical tube in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
which the washing process is conducted and which eliminates
counter-currents, continually disintegrates these compound particles,
and thus enables the entire quantity of the sediment corresponding to
the prevailing current-velocity to pass off with a comparatively slight
expenditure of time on the part of the operator (<a href="#FIG_7">see figure 7</a>).
A wire screen interposed between the churn and cylindrical glass tube prevents
communication of the whirling motion to the column. As the apparatus
works automatically, the analyst has only to observe from time to time
whether or not the turbidity near the top of the tube has disappeared;
and as the sediment accumulates at the bottom of the tall receiver
bottle,<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
no harm is done if the attendant should neglect to change the velocity
in time, except that water will run to waste.</p>

<p>The conical relay glass below the churn serves to retain the coarser
grades of sediments which are not concerned in the velocities employed
in the elutriator tube, and thus prevents injurious attrition. But
these sediments can at any time be stirred up by the incoming current
and brought into the washing tube if desired. In the same manner the
passing-off of the finer sediments can be materially accelerated by
running off rapidly about two-thirds of the turbid column of water
every twenty minutes.</p>

<p>It should be fully understood that prior to attempting such separation,
the “colloidal clay” must first be removed by the subsidence or
centrifugal method, since otherwise much larger grain-sizes may be
carried off at a given velocity.</p>

<p><i>Yoder’s Centrifugal Elutriator.</i>—A very ingenious instrument
which combines the elutriation and sedimentation processes into one,
has been devised by P. A. Yoder, of the Utah Expt. Station. The
elutriator bottle is placed in a centrifuge driven by an electric
motor; it is closed by a glass stopper carrying a delivery tube to a
short distance above the bottom of the elutriator bottle, as well as an
outflow tube ending at the base of the stopper; the latter also carries
a funnel coinciding with the center of rotation. Into this funnel flows
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
gradually the muddy water containing the soil in suspension; and the
rate of its flow, together with the velocity of rotation, determines
the size of the sediment-granules that will be deposited in the
slack-water below the mouth of the delivery tube. The muddy soil-water
is kept agitated in a funnel-shaped reservoir by air-bubbles from a
constant-pressure chamber.</p>

<p>While the principle of this instrument is good, it is quite complicated
and the results obtainable from it in practice have not as yet been
made public. The inventor claims that an analysis may by its means be
completed in less than three hours.</p>

<p>In all hydraulic elutriators a provision for constant pressure in
the reservoir supplying the current of water is needed; although in
Schöne’s and some other instruments a gradually decreasing pressure in
a plain reservoir is employed. A large glass bottle or carboy fitted
with the proper tubes so as to constitute a Mariotte’s bottle (in which
the air enters near the bottom of the vessel), is a very convenient
arrangement.</p>

<p><i>Number of Sediments.</i>—The number of grain-sizes or sediments
into which the soil mass is to be segregated is of course entirely
within the option of the operator. Experience has shown that it is
unnecessary to discriminate very closely between the several sizes of
the coarser portion of the sand, such as those lying between one-fourth
and one-half of a millimeter. But below this point, and especially
between one-tenth of a millimeter and the clay, a proper discrimination
becomes very important. The series first devised by the writer in 1872
is based upon a consecutive doubling of the velocities of the current
from a quarter of a millimeter per second to thirty-two millimeters per
second; the sediment of sixty-four millimeter-velocity corresponding to
a diameter of one-half of a millimeter, will remain in the elutriator.
Above this, as before remarked, the sieve (especially when aided by a
jet of water) effects a satisfactory segregation.</p>

<p>The table below shows the elements of these series both as regards
current-velocities and maximum quartz-grain diameters carried off by
each. In a great many cases, however, it is altogether unnecessary to
go into such detail, and a subdivision into six or seven divisions is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
quite sufficient. Such a subdivision, based upon the doubling of grain-sizes instead of
current-velocities, has been adopted by Prof. Milton Whitney,
of the U. S. Department of Agriculture, and others.</p>

<p><i>Results of such analyses.</i>—A tabular presentation of the results
of analyses made in accordance with the above plan will give a good
idea of the differences between the various grades of soils recognized
in farm practice, to any one accustomed to the study of figures.
But a much more satisfactory showing is made by placing the several
grain-sizes segregated, into small vials or tubes of identical diameter
and placing them in parallel series alongside of each other.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
The curves formed by the surfaces of the several sediment-columns in each
series show to the eye very strikingly the relations of the several
grades of soils to each other, and suggest at once that while gentle
slopes or gently undulating curves belong to soils of intermediate,
loamy character, steep grades and zigzags show soils of extreme types.
This is exemplified in the subjoined Figures:

<p><i>Physical composition corresponding to popular designations of Soil
quality.</i>—The subjoined table illustrates the physical composition
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
of a number of soils from the State of Mississippi, selected for
their representative character, in order to deduce therefrom
approximate definitions of physical character corresponding to popular
designations. This table, published in 1873 in accordance with results
obtained during the two preceding years, does not require any material
modification on account of subsequent investigations. It lacks,
however, a characteristic representative of the predominant soils of
the arid region, viz., the silty soils so prevalent in dry climates,
only approximately represented by No. 165 of the table; hence two such,
from California, exemplifying respectively the valley deposits of the
Sacramento and Colorado rivers, have been added to the list.</p>

<p>It must not, however, be understood that these typical soils
necessarily represent correctly the physical constitution of all
soils falling under the same popular designation; for we are far from
being able as yet to predict accurately in every case the tilling
qualities of a soil material from its physical composition. To do this
it would be necessary not only to know with some degree of precision
the several physical coefficients of each of the several grain-sizes,
and perhaps of many more intermediate ones; but we would also have to
construct a formula according to which each could be given its proper
weight when present in varying proportions, and of varying shapes,
surface condition, and material. For this our present knowledge is
wholly inadequate, if indeed the problem is not beyond the limits of
mathematical computation. We must for the present at least be satisfied
with the empirical approximations afforded us by the constantly
increasing number of such analyses, correlated with farming experience.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">Since the finest grain-sizes above those
classed as “clay” do not tend to “lighten” soils, but even to render
them more intractable (“putty soils”), while coarser ones gradually
change the dense clay-texture into the “loamy,” it is clear that in
between there must be a neutral point, some grain sizes which by
themselves do not influence soil texture either way. Discussion of
numerous physical analyses, and some direct experiments, have led the
writer to conclude that this theoretically neutral grain-size lies
at or near the diameter of .025 mm., or .5 mm. hydraulic value. In
correlating the results of analysis with the tilling qualities of the
soil as to “heaviness and lightness,” therefore, that grain-size may
usually be left out of consideration.

<i>Number of soil grains per gram.</i>—It is of some interest to
consider the number of grains of different sizes that may be contained
in, <i>e. g.</i>, a gram of soil. If for this purpose we assume all the
soil grains to be spherical, we shall obtain the minimum figures, for
most other shapes will pack more closely. King (Physics of Agriculture,
p. 117) calculates such figures for different grain-sizes, assuming the
density to be that of quartz (2.65), with the result that while with
a diameter of one millimeter (1-25 inch) the number of grains would
be 720, and with one-tenth of a mm. 720,000; if made of the finest
particles only, viz., one thousandth of a mm., the number would be
720,000 billions. Probably few of the clayey soils we ordinarily deal
with are of this order; it is doubtless approached in certain fine
plastic clays.</p>

<p><i>Surface afforded by various grain-sizes.</i>—The amount of
<i>surface</i> afforded by a similar amount of soil must naturally
be considered in this connection, since upon it depends not only the
amount of moisture which the soil may hold in the form of superficial
films, but also the extent of surface upon which the weathering
agencies as well as the root hairs of plants may act. Quoting again
from King’s work, we find on the same premises given above for the
<i>number</i> of grains, that their <i>surface</i> would in the case of
grains of one mm. diameter be eleven square feet per pound (about half
a pint) of material; while in the case of the finest grade we should
have 110,538 square feet, or more than two and a half acres.</p>

<p>From actual experiments made with the flow of air through various
soils, King calculates that while in ordinary loam soils the total
surface is about an acre per cubic foot, in fine clay soils it rises to
as much as four acres. If we imagine this large surface to be covered
with even a very thin film of water, it is readily seen how large an
amount may be present in a cubic foot of moist soil.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">E. A. Mitscherlich (Bodenkunds für
Land-und-Forstwirthe; Berlin, 1905) attributes to the surface
offered by the soil particles supreme importance in determining the
productiveness of soils. According to him the internal soil-surface
determines directly the ease with which roots can penetrate the soil;
and he proposes the determination of this factor by means of the heat
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
produced in wetting the soil (“Benetzungswärme”), measured in a
calorimeter, as a substitute for all methods of physical soil analysis,
which are vitiated by the varying shapes and densities of the
particles; while his method gives directly the actual surface. To the
consumption of energy required by difficult penetration he attributes
most of the differences in production, and hence refers to the internal
soil-surface as governing nearly all the other physical factors. The
introduction of many arbitrary assumptions, and the failure to show
that the admitted inaccuracy of the ordinary mechanical soil analyses
are of any practical importance, greatly detract from the cogency
of the rigorous mathematical discussion carried through his work by
Mitscherlich.</p>

<p><i>Influence of the several grain-sizes on soil
texture.</i>—Undoubtedly the most potent of all the sediments
appearing in the above table in influencing soil texture, is the
“clay.” That the materials included under this empirical designation
may vary considerably in different soils, has already been sufficiently
insisted on; and it is doubtful that in the present imperfect state of
our knowledge of the functions of the several physical grain-sizes,
we would be much wiser were we to go to the extreme advocated by
Williams (Forsch. Agr. Phys., vol. 18, p. 225, ff.), of determining
with precision the actual amount of such extremely fine clay particles
as cease altogether to obey the law of gravity when once suspended in
water. It is at least doubtful that the essential property of adhesive
plasticity belongs only to these, for this property doubtless increases
gradually as the size diminishes, although unquestionably not a mere
function of the latter, since it belongs only to the hydrated silicate
of alumina.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90"><i>Ferric Hydrate.</i>—Probably the body
which most commonly modifies materially the adhesive and contractile
properties of the clay substance, is ferric hydrate; the more as on
account of its high density it tends to exaggerate materially, in many
cases, the apparent content of true clay, and the estimate of the
soil’s plasticity based upon it. A good example in point is the case of
soil No. 246 (Miss.) of the above table. This is a heavy clay soil, yet
not excessively adhesive; scarcely as much so as No. 230 (Miss.), the
heavy gray “flatwoods” soil, and not nearly as “sticky” when wet as No.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
173 (Miss.), the prairie subsoil, although containing apparently 15%
more clay than the former, and 7% more than the latter. But No. 246
is a highly ferruginous clay, in which the ferric hydrate is in a
very finely divided condition, and materially influences the physical
qualities of the clay substance. Were it all accumulated in the “clay,”
it would diminish the percentage of true clay by 11.75%, reducing the
clay-percentage to 28.5% which accords more nearly with the soil’s only
moderate adhesiveness, and not excessively heavy tillage.</p>

<p>But it must be remembered that the iron oxid shown in the analysis is
not nearly always in this finely diffused condition. Frequently it
incrusts the sand grains; quite commonly it forms small concretions of
limonite, which themselves act as sand grains; and again, it may be
present in the form of “black sand” or magnetic oxid, as is commonly
the case in California and on the Pacific slope generally. To take
this point properly into account, therefore, it would be necessary to
determine the amount of ferric hydrate actually present in the “clay”
as separated by subsidence of the granular constituents.</p>

<p><i>Other substances.</i>—This circumstance as well as the inevitable
presence of other modifying substances, clearly shows the desirability
of being enabled to examine the physical properties of this “clay”
directly, by collecting its entire amount as obtained in analysis,
instead of merely determining it by weighing fractional portions. When
this is done the analysis is much more valuable as indicating the true
tilling qualities of the land. The increase of bulk suffered by this
substance after wetting, is a very fair index of its content of true
clay, and is preferable to the chemical analysis proposed by some
investigators. For it is quite impossible to distinguish the silica and
alumina derived from the kaolinitic substance proper, from that which
is due to the decomposition of zeolites.</p>

<p>It is possible, however, to determine the possible <i>maximum</i> of
the kaolinite ingredient by taking into consideration the quantitative
ratio according to which silica and alumina combine to form it, viz.,
approximately 46% of the former to 40 of the latter, the rest being
water. By using this calculation we can often demonstrate clearly
the presence in the “clay” of considerable amounts (up to 33%) of
<i>aluminic hydrate</i>; since no zeolitic mass can contain as much
alumina as does kaolinite. Whether the aluminic hydrate be in the form
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
of gibbsite, bauxite, diaspore,<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
or in the gelatinous state, the nature of the soils containing it
proves that it is totally destitute of plasticity and adhesiveness;
and this consideration will often serve to explain the fact that
soils showing in their chemical analysis high percentages of alumina,
nevertheless show quite low degrees of plasticity, adhesiveness and
water absorption. What part it may take in modifying the physical
properties of the soil we can thus far only conjecture.</p>

<p><i>Influence of the granular sediments upon the tilling qualities of
Soils.</i>—Considering the granular sediments by themselves, in the
absence of clay, it may be stated in a general way that while in a
moist condition they flocculate sufficiently to produce a fair tilth,
they will nevertheless on drying collapse into a close arrangement
resulting from the single-grain structure. The form of the grains
being angular instead of rounded, they are apt to form a very closely
packed mass far from suitable to vegetable growth; as will be seen by
an example taken from one of the culture stations of the University of
California, from a piece of land which on the surface would be called
a very sandy loam, but after we descend increases in its content of
fine grains until at a depth varying from eighteen inches to three
feet we find what appears to be a hardpan, which is equally impervious
to roots and water and causes the water to stagnate to such an extent
that after heavy rains the land becomes so boggy as to render plowing
almost impossible without endangering the team. A close examination of
this hardpan shows that, unlike others, it is devoid of any cement, and
when taken out can be readily crushed between the fingers, and softens
in water, but does not become plastic. Its imperviousness is therefore
due solely to the close packing of the sand grains, for it contains
practically no plastic clay, and under the microscope the grains
are seen to be angular-wedge-shaped and composed of the remnants of
granite. The physical analysis shows the following result:

<p>It is doubtful whether this condition of things can be remedied by the
usual measure of breaking up the hardpan either by hand or by means
of giant-powder blasting. Experience seems to show that the effect
is only temporary, and that in the course of time, by the action of
the percolating waters, the particles settle back into their original
impervious condition. It is just possible, however, that if once
penetrated by roots, the intervention of these would permanently
destroy the close structure, so as to make this a fair subsoil for the
growth of trees and other plants. The writer is not aware that this
kind of purely physical hardpan without cement has ever been observed
elsewhere.</p>

<p>This physical condition is doubtless responsible for two other
phenomena, viz., the “putty soils,” and also certain difficulties
experienced in irrigation.</p>

<p>“<i>Putty Soils</i>” is the name popularly given in the Cotton States,
and probably elsewhere, to soils usually occurring in low ground and
also known as “cray-fishy.” They consist of very uniform, powdery
sediment, with little or no coarse sand and still less of clay to
render them coherent. When wet these soils behave precisely as would
glazier’s putty, adhering to the surface of even the best-polished
plowshare, so that no furrow-slice can be turned and the plow is soon
dragged out of the ground. At a very closely limited condition of
moisture such lands may plow fairly well; but when this limit is passed
in the least (as sometimes happens in the course of a single day), it
turns up only hard clods, which in a few hours of sunshine become so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
hard that no instrument of tillage short of a sledgehammer will make
any impression upon them. The physical analysis of these usually gray
soils shows that they contain only a trifling amount of clay; perhaps 1
or 2%, playing the part of linseed oil in making putty out of whiting.
Even the addition of lime does not help such soils much, because
there is little or no clay to flocculate. They are, as a matter of
fact, among the most refractory lands the farmer has to deal with. A
soil showing similar behavior, though not quite as extreme as in the
case of the Gulf or Cotton States’ soils in question, occurs at the
culture substation at Paso Robles, California, and is probably closely
correlated to the physical hardpan referred to above. The physical
analysis of this soil yielded the following result:</p>

<p>It would seem the best and almost only remedy to be applied to
such soils as these is the introduction of vegetable matter or
green-manuring, by which their texture is loosened: for the hauling of
mere clay upon the land would hardly accomplish the purpose intended,
within the limits of farm economy.</p>

<p><i>Dust Soils</i>, which during the dry season are even in their
natural condition so loose as to rise in clouds and render travel very
uncomfortable, are not uncommon in arid countries, <i>e. g.</i>, in
Washington and adjacent parts of Oregon, on the uplands bordering the
Columbia, Yakima and Snake rivers. The physical analyses of three of
such soils, given in the table below, will convey some idea of their
peculiarities in this respect.

<p><i>Slow penetration of Water.</i>—Soils of this class are wetted
with extreme slowness by irrigation water; so that when first taken
under cultivation it sometimes takes twenty-four hours to soak the
land for twelve inches in each direction. Irrigation furrows must be
placed very close together and in large numbers, in order to ensure
the wetting of the soil so that the crop shall not suffer from lack
of moisture at a distance of two or not more than three feet. Where
the irrigation furrows are drawn farther apart a fine stand of grain
may be seen within eighteen inches of the same, while farther away
the crops may be dying from lack of moisture. This difficulty is by
no means infrequent in the arid region, and is difficult to overcome
except by frequent and thorough tillage, which gradually increases the
rapidity of water-penetration; as has been shown in the soils of the
alluvial prairies of the Yakima country in the State of Washington.
It is necessary, however, to take care that they shall always contain
an adequate amount of humus or vegetable matter, in order to prevent
re-consolidation by the burning-out of the humus during the warm,
rainless season.</p>

<p>There is an unmistakable resemblance between these dust soils of the
Northwest and the “putty” soils mentioned above; both showing a very
low percentage of clay with a relatively large amount of the finest
sediments, with a sudden downward break of the curve before the coarser
grain-sizes are reached. It would seem as though the absence of these
intermediate grains favors the close packing of the fine sediments
in the interstices of the coarse ones, thus bringing about the
imperviousness, which is the chief obstacle to their cultivation.</p>

<p><i>Effects of coarse Sand.</i>—Coarse sand intermingled with heavy
clay soils has but little effect in improving the tilling qualities,
unless carried to such excess as renders it financiallyimpracticable.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
In actual practice it is frequently possible to improve such soils
by properly distributing upon them the washings of the adjacent
hills, which will always carry sands of many grades; and when it is
intended to improve garden land by hauling sand it is important to
choose the latter so as to complement the deficient grain-sizes of the
soil. The sand of wind drifts or dunes is generally well adapted to
such improvement, being, as Udden<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
has shown, of a fairly definite composition of sufficiently wide range
of grain-sizes for the purpose.</p>

<p>The effects of humus in modifying soil texture are discussed farther on.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle">THE DENSITY AND VOLUME-WEIGHT<br> OF SOILS.</span></h3>
</div>

<p>Aside from the humus-substances the specific gravity of the common
soil constituents, taken individually, do not vary widely; kaolinite
being the lightest (2.60), feldspar next (2.62); then quartz (2.65),
calcite (2.72). Mica and hornblende range (according to their iron
contents) from 2.72 to over 3.0. The average specific gravity of soils
of ordinary humus content only will thus range between 2.55 and 2.75;
sandy soils approaching very closely to that of quartz alone.</p>

<p><i>Volume-Weight.</i>—The specific gravity of the soil is, however, of
little practical consequence compared with the “<i>volume-weight</i>,”
<i>i. e.</i>, the weight of the natural soil as compared with an equal
bulk of water. A cubic foot of water weighs 62½ pounds; a similar
volume of soil usually weighs more, but in the case of peaty lands may
actually (when dry) weigh less. The extreme range is from 110 pounds
for calcareous, and somewhat less for siliceous sand, to as little
as 30 to 50 pounds in the case of peaty and swamp soils. It may be
conveniently remembered that while average arable loams range from
80 to about 95 pounds per cubic foot, “heavy” clay soils range from
75 pounds down to 69, observed by the writer in the case of certain
alluvial soils, poor in humus,<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
of the Sacramento river, California. Manured garden soils, and the mold
surface soil of deciduous forests, generally contain so much humus as
to depress their weight considerably, varying according to their state
of tilth from 66 to 70 pounds per cubic foot.</p>

<p><i>Weight per acre-foot.</i>—As for practical purposes and
calculations it is often desirable to know approximately the weight
in pounds of an acre (43,560 square feet) one foot deep, it is
convenient to remember that in the case of sandy land, this weight (per
“acre-foot”) may be assumed at four millions of pounds; for loams, at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
3½ millions; for clay lands, 3¼ millions; for humus or garden land and
woods earth, about 3 millions of pounds; for reedy swamp and peaty
lands, 2 to 2½ millions.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">The loose tilth and humus-content of the
surface soil will in general cause it to weigh less, bulk for bulk,
than the underlying subsoil, even when the latter is more clayey;
moreover, the continuous pressure from above will tend to consolidate
the subsoil and substrata. Warington (Phys. Properties of Soils, pp.
46, 47) gives interesting data on this point from the Rothamstead
fields, as follows:</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">The influence of humus and unhumified
organic matter, as well as of tillage, in diminishing the volume-weight
of soils is here strikingly shown.</p>

<p><i>Air-space in Natural Soils.</i>—The difference between the specific
gravity as usually determined, and the volume-weight of soils, is of
course caused by the large amount of air contained in them when dry,
but which in wetting them is partially or wholly replaced by water.</p>

    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 10.</span>—Various possible
              arrangements of soil particles.</p>
</div>

<p>Theoretically, assuming all soil grains to be globular, and packed as
closely as possible (in oblique order), the space not filled by them
would be the same for all sizes, whether that of marbles, or so minute
as to be hardly felt between the fingers; and would be 25.95 per cent
of the soil volume.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
If the same globular particles were packed as loosely as possible,
<i>i. e.</i>, in square instead of oblique order (see figures 10 and
11), the vacant space would be 47.64 per cent If however we imagine
each sphere to be itself composed of a number of smaller ones, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
empty space will obviously be greatly increased, to an extent
proportionate to the diminution of solid mass thus brought about. The
pore-space might in that case, with the oblique arrangement of the
globules as shown in <a href="#FIG_10">Fig. 10</a>, be as high as 74.05 per cent
But since the soil particles may be of all shapes and sizes within the same soil,
and usually fit much more closely than would globular grains, the empty
space rarely approaches (only in certain alluvial soils and in loose
mulches) to the figure last named. In sandy soils it may fall as low as
20%, and in coarse gravelly soils even as low as 10%. Most cultivated
soils range between 35 and 50% of empty space.</p>

<p><i>Effects of Tillage.</i>—That these figures can be only
approximations is obvious from the consideration that one and the
same soil will vary materially in its volume-weight according to its
temporary condition of greater or less compactness. After land has
been beaten by winter rains, its volume-weight will be found to have
materially increased from the well-tilled condition brought about
by thorough cultivation. This difference is strikingly seen when,
in plowing, the height of the ground on the land side is compared
with that of the turned furrow-slice in well conditioned loamy land.
This loose condition is called <i>tilth</i>, and it results from
the formation of relatively large, complex crumbs<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
or floccules, between which there are large air spaces that were wholly
absent in the untilled land; the floccules themselves being also more
loosely aggregated than was the case before tillage.</p>

surface by winter rains, and in its upper portion consisting largely of
single grains; while the plowed land, toward which the furrow-slices
have been turned, is greatly increased in height and volume and
consists almost wholly of variously-shaped and-sized aggregates or
floccules, loosely piled upon one another and separated by large
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
interspaces. The increase in volume from consolidated clay to
crumb-structure is given by Wollny (Forsch., vol. 20, p. 13, 1897) at
41.9%, to powder as 33%. On moistening dry clay increased 36.9%, quartz
powder 8.01%. When land is plowed in the proper moisture-condition the
crumbs of floccules are held together by the surface tension of the
capillary films (menisci) of water at the points of contact. In the
case of sands, the crumbs will collapse into single grains whenever the
water-films evaporate, unless some cementing substance was dissolved
or suspended in the water. (<a href="#FIG_12">See figure 12</a>). Lime carbonate
is one of the substances most commonly found permanently cementing the floccules;
hence the ready tillage of most calcareous soils, and especially the
loose texture of the “loess” of the western United States, and of
Europe and Asia. In these deposits we find sandy and silt aggregates or
concretions ranging from ten or more inches in length (loess puppets)
to microscopic size, held together by lime carbonate, but collapsing
into silt and sand when the material is treated with acid so as to
dissolve the cement. The rough surfaces of these aggregates, gripping
into each other, explain the stability of the steep loess cliffs in the
United States, as well as in northeastern China, as observed by Von
Richthofen and Pumpelly.</p>

<p><i>Clay</i> is most frequently the substance which imparts at least
temporary stability to the crumbs and crumb-structure; this is one of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
its most important functions in soils, as it serves to <i>maintain</i>
tilth once imparted by cultivation, even after the land dries out.
Beating rains, and cultivation while too wet, will in this case of
course destroy the crumbs and the loose tilth.</p>

<p>Other substances which greatly aid the maintenance of tilth are the
several humates (of lime, magnesia, iron), which when fresh are
colloidal (jelly-like) like clay itself, but unlike the latter, when
once dried do not resume their plastic form by wetting (Schloesing).
The crumbs thus formed are therefore quite permanent and contribute to
the looseness of soils rich in humus. One part of lime humate is said
by Schloesing to be equal in cementing power to eleven parts of clay.</p>

<p>Silica, silicates and ferric hydrate are sometimes found cementing soil
crumbs, wholly or in part.</p>

<p>The importance of the ready penetration of air, water and roots thus
rendered possible is obvious; and the question arises how it happens
that wild plants are able to do without tillage.</p>

<p><i>How Nature Tills.</i>—When we examine the undisturbed soil of woods
or prairie in the humid region, we will as a rule find the natural
surface soil in a very good condition of tilth; the obvious cause being
the presence in it of an abundant network of surface roots and rootlets
of grasses and herbs, which in connection with the fallen foliage
prevent the beating and compacting of the soil surface; which can be
seen to happen before the observer’s eyes whenever a heavy rain falls
on a bare land surface, however well tilled.</p>

<p><i>Crusting of Soils.</i>—In some soils, especially of the Gulf
States, the beating of rain followed by warm sunshine so effectually
compacts the surface that in the case of taprooted plants like cotton,
it becomes necessary to cultivate after each rain, so as to break the
crust that would otherwise not only prevent the proper circulation of
air, but would also serve to waste the moisture of the land. The same
land in the wild condition suffered no such change, being protected by
the native vegetation, and by fallen leaves. (<a href="#Page_120">See chapt. 8</a>).</p>

<p><i>Soils of the arid region.</i>—In the regions of deficient rainfall
the conditions are modified in several respects. Grass sward rarely
exists, nearly all grasses assuming the habit of growing in tufts or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
bunches some distance (a foot or two) apart; hence the name of “bunch
grass” commonly used, which however means not any one definite kind
of grass, but serves to distinguish the grasses of the uplands from
those of the moist lowlands, where true sward may be found. Between
these bunches of grass the soil is fully exposed, and being free from
roots and leaf-covering is compacted, <i>unless its nature is such
that the usually gentle rains do not produce a serious crusting of the
surface</i>.</p>

<p>That such is actually the predominant nature of the soils formed under
arid influences has already been stated; and thus the hard-baked
soil-surface so often seen in the Eastern United States in unplowed
bare land, or during the prevalence of a drought, is rarely seen in
the arid region. The clay lands that do exist are usually sufficiently
calcareous to possess the property of “slaking” into crumbs whenever
wetted after drying. But where this is not the case, the stony hardness
brought about by the long dry and warm season is long in being removed
by the winter rains.</p>

<p><i>Changes of soil-volume on wetting and drying.</i>—The behavior of
colloidal clay in the above respects has already been described above
(<a href="#Page_69">see chapt. 4, page 59</a>). It is obvious that whenever soils
contain a large proportion of such clay, their behavior on wetting and drying
will approximate to those of the pure clay. This is exemplified in the
heavy clay, or so-called “prairie soils” of the United States, which
when thoroughly wetted in spring will, during a dry summer, form wide,
gaping cracks. These in the long summers of the arid region may extend
to the depth of several feet, with a width of as much as three and
more inches at the surface of the ground. This, of course, contributes
greatly to the drying-out of the soil to the same depth, and results
as well in the mechanical tearing of the root-system of growing
plants; sometimes causing the total destruction of vegetation. In some
clay soils it happens that after a rain or irrigation, the shrinkage
occurring upon the advent of warm sunshine will cause the surface crust
to so contract around the stem, <i>e. g.</i>, of grain, as to constrict
and <i>injure the bark</i>, causing serious injury to the crop. In
soils of this character very <i>thorough tillage in preparing for a
crop</i>, and the maintenance of <i>a loose surface during its growth,
are of course extremely essential</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span></p>

<p>In the arid region it will frequently happen that such soils when not
tilled to a sufficient depth, will during the later part of the summer
so shrink and crack beneath the shallow-tilled surface layer that the
latter will bodily fall into the cracks, exposing the roots to all the
deleterious influences of mechanical lesion and drying-out. It is thus
obvious that the cultivation of such soils should not be undertaken at
all by those not naturally able and willing to bestow upon them, to
the fullest extent, the deep and thorough tillage which is absolutely
essential in the utilization of their usually high productive power.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90"><i>Extent of Shrinkage.</i>—The extent of
this shrinkage in drying, and subsequent expansion in wetting, have
been measured by the writer by the use of the sieve cylinder described
below (<a href="#Page_209">chapt. 11, p. 209</a>), as serving for the determination
of the water capacity of soils. When a soil of the kind above referred to is
placed in the sieve cylinder in the tilled (flocculated) condition,
then allowed to absorb its maximum of water and then dried at 100
degrees C., the contraction in drying can be very strikingly seen, and
its amount measured by filling up the empty space with mercury; then
measuring the latter after expelling the surplus by means of a ground
glass plate laid on top. The contraction of several heavy clay soils,
thus measured, has been found by the writer to range from 28 to as much
as 40 per cent of the original bulk.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
The soil thus contracted, when again wetted, does not return altogether
to its original bulk, but remains in a more or less compacted
condition, like that of a soil which has been rained upon.</p>

<p>The expansion and contraction of a heavy clay soil on wetting and
drying are well illustrated in the <a href="#FIG_13">figure below</a>, in which the
soils are shown in the shallow cylinder which serves for the determination of
water-holding power (<a href="#Page_209">see chapt. 11, p. 209</a>). The middle
figure shows in profile the expansion of a dry, pulverized “black adobe,” struck
level, when allowed to absorb its maximum of water; it rises above the rim
of the sieve-box to nearly the half height of the latter. The outside
figure to the right shows the same soil after drying; that to the
left, a red clay soil similarly treated. It is easily seen that these
variations in volume may bring about very marked results in the fields;

the surface of which, apart from the cracks usually formed, may be
several inches lower in the dry season than during wet weather.</p>

    <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 13.</span>—Expansion
           on Wetting and Contraction on Drying of heavy clay soils.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Contraction on Wetting.</i>—In the case of alkali soils containing
much carbonate of soda, a very notable <i>contraction</i> occurs in
<i>wetting</i> the loose, dry soil. The cause is here obviously the
collapse of the crumbs, formed in dry tillage or crushing, into single
grains, closely packed. The same result is observed in the naturally
depressed “alkali spots” (<a href="#Page_422">see chapt. 22</a>).</p>

<p>“<i>Hog-wallows.</i>”—In the <i>field</i> the wetting of cracked clay
soils produces some very curious effects. The effect of the first
light rains usually is to crumble off the edges or angles near the
surface, the materials thus loosened falling into the lower portion
of the cracks. This is repeated at each successive shower followed by
sunshine, the crevices thus becoming partly filled with surface soil.
When, subsequently, the heavier and more continuous rains wet the land
fully, also causing the consolidated mass in the crevices to expand,
the latter cannot close on account of the surplus material having
fallen into them; the result being that the intermediate portions of
the soil are compelled to bulge upward, sometimes for six or more
inches, creating a very uneven, humpy surface, well-known in the
southwestern United States as “hog-wallows.”<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
Such a surface is always therefore an indication of an <i>extremely
heavy soil, difficult to cultivate</i>; yet embracing some of the most
highly and permanently productive lands known in the United States, and
in India, where the “regur” lands of the Deccan are of this character;
they have been cultivated without fertilization for thousands of years.
The subjoined physical analyses of lands of such extreme character as
to be almost uncultivatable will serve to exemplify their physical
composition.</p>

<p>It will be noted that in both these extremely heavy soils the sum of
the clay and finest sediments is a little over 83%.</p>

<p>It should be stated that both these soils after being thoroughly
wetted become so adhesive that it is almost impossible to travel over
the tracts occupied by them, and that they are practically almost
untillable, being too adhesive when wet; yet if allowed to dry to a
certain extent (varying within very narrow limits) they turn up by the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
plow in large clods, which after a few hours of sunshine become of
stony hardness and will resist all efforts at pulverization or the
production of tilth.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p><i>Calcareous Clay Soils crumble on drying.</i>—The heavy clay
soils of some of the calcareous prairies of the Southwest, instead
of contracting into a stony mass on drying, on the contrary resolve
into a mass of crumbs, thus producing excellent tilth. This occurs
even though the land may have been plowed when wet, and of course is a
great advantage. The most striking exemplification of this peculiarity
occurs in the heavy but profusely fertile “buckshot” clay lands of the
Yazoo bottom, in Mississippi, where it is usual to plant corn and sweet
potatoes in the semi-fluid mud left after an overflow, after turning a
shallow furrow, then covering by turning another. To the onlooker it
seems impossible that such plantings could be successful; but within
a short time the muddy surface becomes a bed of crumbs (“buckshot”),
forming a seed-bed not readily excelled by any made by artificial means.
Hence, largely, the almost invariable success of crops in the Yazoo region.</p>

<p><i>Port Hudson Bluff.</i>—The same clay produces a most unpleasant
result at the foot of the Port Hudson bluff, where it crops out some
feet above low water. When after a freshet the water level falls below
this stratum, on drying the clay disintegrates into crumbs just as does
the Yazoo buckshot soil; with the result that at the next rise, the
loose mass subsides into the river as a flood of mud. Thus the foot of
the bluff is being constantly undermined, and the falling of the bluff
scarp has obliged the town above to recede many hundreds of feet from
its original historic site.</p>

<p>The exact proportions of lime carbonate necessary to produce this
phenomenon, and its necessary relations to clay substance and other
physical soil ingredients, yet remain to be investigated.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
<i>Loamy and Sandy Soils.</i>—It is largely the <i>absence</i> of
these extreme changes of volume that renders the cultivation of loamy
or even sandy lands so much more easy, and the success of crops so much
more safe, than is the case in clay soils. Whenever the content of
colloidal clay diminishes below 15%, the shrinkage in drying from the
wet condition becomes so slight as to cause no inconvenience; while in
sandy soils properly speaking, no perceptible change in volume occurs.</p>

<p>Peaty soils, however, and all those containing a relatively large
amount of humus, are also liable to visible shrinkage when passing from
the wet to the dry condition. But on account of their looseness and
porosity such shrinkage does not usually result in the formation of
cracks or rupture of the roots, as is the case in heavy clay lands. The
entire mass of the soil then shrinks downwards, but rarely forms cracks
on the surface. Hence the introduction of humus into “heavy” soils is
among the best means of improving their tilling qualities.</p>

<p><i>Formation of Surface Crusts.</i>—Some soils, especially those
of a clay-loam character, are very liable to the formation of hard
surface crusts from the beating of rains, and from surface irrigation;
owing, doubtless, to the ready deflocculation of their clay substance.
It is not easy to define the precise physical composition conducive
to this crust formation; but the subjoined physical analyses show
examples of soils in which this tendency is very prominent and is
frequently annoying, in that when they occur in the regions of
frequent summer rains, it becomes necessary after each one to till the
surface in hoed crops (<i>e. g.</i>, in cotton-fields) in order to
prevent the injurious effects of such consolidation of the surface.
It may, of course, be prevented by mulching, or on the large scale by
green-manuring, to such extent as to prevent contraction.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">The subjoined physical analyses of two soils
from the Brown-Loam region of Northern Mississippi (<a href="#Page_487">see chap. 24</a>),
shows the composition of lands excellent in every respect other than
the tendency to crust after each rain:

mm., or .5 mm. hydraulic value. A higher proportion of clay, even
though associated with a similarly high or even larger proportion of
these fine sediments, seems to prevent crusting, probably because
the swelling of the clayey ingredient on wetting and its extravagant
contraction in drying breaks up the continuity of the surface. The
heaviest clay soils, such as those shown on a preceding page, neither
crust nor crumble on drying after wetting, but contract into lumps of
stony hardness, <i>as a whole</i>.</p>

<p>The burning-out of the humus from well-tilled surface soils during the
extended heat and dryness of rainless summers, brings about such a
contraction or packing of the surface soil of orchards in California
as to greatly reduce their productiveness, and to render necessary
diligent green-manuring as the only practical remedy. In many cases,
liming of the surface also serves well to prevent this injurious
effect, which to some extent of course follows surface irrigation as
well as rains.</p>

<p>In most soils, repeated alternate wetting and drying <i>in place</i>
produces a loose, flocculated texture, so long as no deflocculation is
brought about by mechanical causes, such as beating rains or running water.</p>

<p><i>Effects of Frost on the Soil.</i>—The expansion suffered by water
in freezing necessarily tends to separate the soil particles previously
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
held together by the surface tension of the capillary water, or
otherwise flocculated or cemented. Freezing of the soil is therefore of
material assistance in <i>disintegrating</i> cloddy, ill-conditioned
soils, leaving them in loose, crumbly condition after the ice has
melted and the surplus water drained off; so as to materially
facilitate tillage and root penetration. When, however, soils thus
circumstanced are tilled or trodden while too wet, they quickly become
puddled, being practically reduced to single-grain structure. (<a href="#Page_110">See this
chapt. p. 110</a>). Hence the injury caused by allowing cattle to range in
winter on cultivated land subject to freezing and thawing, which it
sometimes takes years to correct.</p>

<p>A disagreeable effect often produced by the freezing and thawing of
wet lands is the “heaving-cut” of grain, resulting from the upward
expansion of the surface soil in freezing, that may readily rupture the
roots; while on thawing, the soil surrounding the upheaved stool is apt
to settle down, especially in case of a rain, leaving the stool and
roots exposed either to drying or freezing, as the case may be. Hence
the desire of grain farmers in northern climates, for a sufficient
covering of snow to protect the fall-sown grain, rather than an “open
winter,” during which the grain is exposed to alternate freezes and
thaws, or extreme cold.</p>

<p>In certain soils, notably in those liable to crusting (<a href="#Page_117">p. 117</a>),
instead of heaving the soil, the water in freezing emerges bodily from small
cracks, in foliated or wire-like forms (“ice-flowers”) resembling those
of native silver, and formed substantially in the same way, by a kind
of “wire-drawing” process, aided by crystallization.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">Small ice-crystals formed on the surface
of small crevices filled with water cause others to be formed at
their lower ends, and the expansion occurring in freezing, forces the
ice upward; the process repeating itself under favorable conditions,
until the stalks or sheets of ribbed ice grow to a height of several
inches. This phenomenon is especially frequent in the middle cotton
States—Arkansas, Tennessee, northern Mississippi, etc., where frequent
changes from rainstorms or thaws to cold northwest winds occur in winter.</p>

<span class="h_subtitle">SOIL AND SUBSOIL.</span></h3>
</div>

<h4>CAUSES AND PROCESS OF DIFFERENTIATION.<br> HUMUS.</h4>

<p><i>Soil and Subsoil Ill-defined.</i>—While the general mass of rock
debris formed by the action of the agencies heretofore discussed as
soil-material, may under proper conditions become soil capable of
supporting useful plant growth, universal experience has long ago
recognized and established the distinction between soil and subsoil:
by which are ordinarily meant, respectively, the portion of the
soil-material usually subjected to tillage, and what lies beneath.
There can be no question about the practical importance of this
distinction; but the definition of the two terms, as commonly given in
some works of agriculture, is both incomplete and, in its application
to many cases, partly misleading.</p>

<p>The differentiation of soil and subsoil is due partly to the action of
organic matter and micro-organisms, partly to physico-chemical causes,
now to be discussed in detail.</p>

<h4>THE ORGANIC AND ORGANIZED CONSTITUENTS<br> OF SOILS.</h4>

<p><i>Humus in the Surface soil.</i>—The most obvious mark of distinction
between soil and subsoil is, usually, the darker tint of the former,
due to the presence of humus or vegetable mold, which becomes most
apparent by darkening of the tint when the soil is moistened. Thus
soils having a gray tint when dry, may become almost black when wetted.
When no such deepening of color occurs in wetting, the absence or great
deficiency of humus may safely be inferred. The only other substance
whose presence may invalidate the conclusions based upon the darkening
of the soil tint, is ferric hydrate (iron rust), which itself possesses
the property of darkening on wetting, and may effectually cover either
the presence or the absence of humus.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span></p>

<p>Since the formation of the humus depends upon the decomposition of
organic matter (mostly of the cellulose group) derived partly from
the roots, partly from the leaves and stems of plants growing and
dying on the soil, its accumulation near the surface is natural. But
since the depth to which roots penetrate varies greatly not only with
different plants, but very essentially in conformity with the greater
or less penetrability of the soil and subsoil, the depth to which the
dark humus tint may reach vertically varies correspondingly, from two
or three inches to several feet. In the case of soils that have been
formed by the gradual filling-up of swamps or marshes, the humus-tint
may reach to several yards depth.</p>

<p><i>Surface Soil, and Subsoil.</i>—It is thus apparent that the term
“surface soil,” while commonly confined by the farmer to the portion
turned by the plow or usually reached in cultivation by any implements,
may or may not belong, functionally, to layers of greatly varying
thickness. Similarly the term <i>subsoil</i> may or may not refer,
in individual cases, to parts of the soil mass materially different
from the surface soil. Yet this distinction is of no mean practical
importance, because the efficacy of one of the most common measures of
soil improvement, viz., subsoil plowing or “<i>subsoiling</i>,” depends
materially upon the differences between soil and subsoil in each
particular case. Most of the diversity of opinion regarding the merits
of this operation is simply the result of a corresponding diversity in
the natural facts and cultural practice of each case.</p>

<p><i>Causes of the Differentiation of Soil and Subsoil.</i>—One of the
prominent points of difference between surface soils and subsoils has
already been mentioned in the usual predominance of root-mass in the
upper layers; to which is added a part at least of the substance of
fallen leaves and stems of its vegetation. How much of this vegetable
mass ultimately becomes converted into humus, as well as the nature of
the product formed, depends upon a great variety of circumstances; some
of which have already been mentioned in connection with the general
discussion of humification (<a href="#Page_20">chapt. 2, p. 20</a>). Briefly stated,
the main controlling conditions are: the amount of water or moisture present,
the access of air (oxygen), a proper temperature, and the presence of
the several organisms which in the course of time take part in the
process of soil-formation.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span></p>

<p><i>Ulmin Substances; Sour Humus</i> (Germ. Rohhumus).—In the presence
of so much moisture or liquid water as will materially impede the
access of air, and with the concurrence of reasonably low temperatures,
the organisms that at first take the chief role in the transformation
of the vegetable tissues into humus-like substances are bacteria. But
the antiseptic nature of the compounds thus formed<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
soon puts an end to their activity, and thereafter the process seems to
be a purely chemical one, and very slow. In peat bogs, the transition
from the fresh, dead stems and roots to brown peat is easily followed
downward, white cellulose fibers remaining apparently unchanged to some
depth; so that such fiber has been used for tissues and paper. The
solid decomposition-products are brown substances, partly soluble in
water and imparting to it a brown or coffee color (frequently seen in
the drains of marshes) and an acid reaction; the latter due to ulmic
(as well as apocrenic) acid, readily soluble in caustic and carbonated
alkalies, and forming insoluble salts with the earths and metals; while
another portion, ulmin, is insoluble in the same, but gradually becomes
soluble by oxidation.</p>

<p>The gaseous products formed under these conditions are carbonic dioxid
and “marsh gas” (methan, CH₄), the former predominating in the early
stages; while later, the carburetted hydrogen predominates, rendering
the gas readily inflammable.</p>

<p><i>Sour Soils.</i>—The “sour” soils thus produced in nature in
presence of excess of water bear only “sour” growth, such as sedges
and rushes, of little agricultural value; they usually require
reclamation processes before becoming adapted to ordinary crops. In
old forests of northern climates a peaty and more or less acid layer
is sometimes formed on the surface, above the black woods-earth, and
retards somewhat the full production of such land when taken into
cultivation.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>Marshes and swamps, both fresh and salt, as above stated usually
show coffee-colored waters, which are also characteristic of the streams
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
that drain them, until by intermixture with waters containing
lime salts, the ulmic substances are neutralized and precipitated.
Such neutralization, preferably by means of lime, is the first step
towards the reclamation of lands bearing “sour” vegetation. The acid
reaction characterizing the ulmic substances is also characteristic
of many woodlands, notably in the United States of the soils of
the “Long-leaf-pine” region of the Cotton States, both upland and
lowland, as well as of many deciduous forests in northern climates.
Hence liming, whether artificial or natural, effects a most notable
improvement, together with a marked change of vegetation, in these lands.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">It has been long known that after
long-continued cultivation, soils originally of neutral or slightly
basic reaction become acid: and the liming of such lands is an ancient
practice in Europe. The matter, however, received but scant attention
until Wheeler and Hartwell, of the Rhode Island Experiment Station,
demonstrated the almost universal acid condition of the older lands of
that State, and the excellent effects produced by neutralization with
lime, or even with the alkali carbonates.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
The current neutralization of the humus-acids is unquestionably one of
the cardinal advantages of calcareous lands; for such as contain only
small amounts of lime carbonate will of course become acid more quickly
under cultivation.</p>

<p><i>Humin Substances.</i>—In the presence of only a moderate amount
of moisture, therefore under the influence of a more or less rapid
circulation of air, and in the presence of earthy carbonates
(especially that of lime) to prevent the formation of acids, or to
neutralize them as formed, the normal process of humification occurs;
mainly under the influence of fungous instead of bacterial growths. The
various molds take a prominent part in the conversion of the vegetable
substance into black, neutral, insoluble humus compounds. Such fungous
vegetation is always accompanied by the evolution of carbonic gas,
and the resulting fungous tissues are markedly richer in nitrogen and
carbon than the substance of the higher plants from which they were
derived (<a href="#Page_142">see chapt. 9</a>). Comparative analyses show that in
the normal process of humification of vegetable substances, oxygen and hydrogen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
are eliminated in the form of water and carbonic dioxid, while at
the same time there is an increase in the percentage of carbon, and
generally also of nitrogen; the latter more particularly in the case of
vegetable matter not very rich in that element. When once humification
is complete, oxidation, especially under arid conditions, bears mainly
upon the carbon and hydrogen, so that the nitrogen content may rise to
very high figures; while another portion is ultimately wholly oxidized,
with the formation of nitrates, under the influence of the nitrifying
bacteria, this being the process chiefly efficient in the nutrition of
vegetation with nitrogen.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">As a matter of course, the several organic
compounds contained in plants may continue to exist in soils for some
time, varying according to conditions of temperature and moisture. Thus
dextrin, glucose, and even lecithin and nuclein have been reported to
be found. The activity of the numerous fungous and bacterial ferments
under favoring conditions will, of course, limit the continued
existence of such compounds somewhat narrowly, so that they can hardly
be considered as active soil ingredients save in so far as they favor
the development of the bacterial flora.</p>

<p><i>Porosity of Humus.</i>—One of the essential features of natural
humus is its great porosity, whereby it not only becomes highly
absorbent of water and gases, but is also gradually oxidized, probably
under the influence of bacteria. For this oxidation, as measured by
the evolution of carbonic gas, progresses most rapidly under the same
conditions as to moisture, temperature and access of air, that are
known to be most favorable to fungous and bacterial growth. Hence the
formation of carbonic dioxid in the soil is assumed to be the measure
of the intensity of such activity.</p>

<p><i>Physical and Chemical Nature of the Humus Substances.</i>—The humus
substances are gelatinous when moist, but are neither markedly adhesive
or plastic. Like the other colloidal substances of the soil, they serve
to retain both gases and vapors, including moisture, liquid water,
and its dissolved solids. In the natural, porous condition they are
powerfully absorbent of gases, including especially aqueous vapor. Dry
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
humus swells up visibly when wetted, the volume-weight increasing to
the extent of two to eight times; so that humus stands foremost in this
respect among the soil constituents. The <i>density</i> of natural
humus is about 1.4, being the lightest of the soil constituents. Hence
soils rich in humus are “light” not only in the farmer’s sense of being
easily tilled when not too wet, but also of light weight for equal
volumes when compared with clayey and sandy soils. Some data bearing
upon these points are given in the table<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
below, for the substances moderately and uniformly packed:</p>

</table>

<p>These data show strikingly the effects produced by the several physical
soil constituents upon some of its physical properties.</p>

<p><i>Chemical Nature.</i>—While humus artificially produced by the
action of caustic alkalies upon sugar or cellulose is free from
nitrogen, all naturally occurring humus contains the latter.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">It is not, however, present in the form of
ammonia, as it cannot be set free by treatment in the cold with lime
or alkalies. When, however, natural humus is <i>boiled</i> with these
substances, ammonia is slowly given off, but the process continues
indefinitely and it seems to be impossible to expel all the nitrogen
in this manner. This behavior being characteristic of amido-compounds,
it is presumable, in view of the slightly acid nature of the humus
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
substances, that natural humus is largely of an amidic constitution.
Artificial humic acid, formed by the action of caustic alkalies upon
sugar, gums or cellulose, combines with ammonia as with other bases,
and at first the ammonia can be readily expelled from this as from
other ammonia salts. But after the lapse of some time it seems that
the amidic condition is assumed, so that caustic lye acts but very
slowly and cannot expel the whole of the nitrogen present. This is very
important in connection with the practice of fertilization, as any
ammonia taken up by or generated in the soil is thus in the course of
time rendered comparatively inert, and unavailable to vegetation until
nitrified.</p>

<p><i>Progressive Changes.</i>—The natural neutral humin and ulmin, as
found, <i>e. g.</i>, in the lower portions of peat beds, are in the
course of time by oxidation converted into ulmic and humic acids,
capable of combining with bases; by still farther oxidation they form
apocrenic and crenic acids, readily soluble in water and in part
forming soluble salts with lime, magnesia and other bases. These acids
act strongly upon the more readily decomposable silicates of the soil,
and in the course of time may dissolve out, and aid in the removal by
leaching, of most of the plant-food ingredients as well as the ferric
hydrate of a soil. Thus red or rust-colored soils may be rendered
almost white by continued “swamping” with stagnant water, and be
greatly impoverished; and it is doubtless largely through this agency
that the underclays of coal beds and the lower portions of peat beds,
as well as peat and coal ashes, are almost wholly destitute of mineral
plant food.</p>

<p><i>The Phases of Humification.</i>—The progressive changes involved
in the process of humification of vegetable matter are illustrated in
the table below,<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
together with the farther changes by which such matter may ultimately
be transformed into the several varieties of coal, and finally into
anthracite, which already represents nearly pure carbon, but in nature
has sometimes been still farther transformed into graphite (black-lead)
and diamond.

<p>The steady increase of carbon and nitrogen, together with a
corresponding decrease of oxygen, are well illustrated in the analyses,
especially in the strictly comparable series of peat samples from
various depths. In this case there is also a steady decrease of
hydrogen, and an increase of ash from 2.72% in the surface layer, to
9.16 at 80 inches depth. This increase is due in the main, of course,
to the progressive volatilization of the organic matter in the forms of
carbonic dioxid and marsh gas (methan, CH₄).</p>

<p>In considering this table it should not be forgotten that while normal
humus stands very close to peat, and the latter when compressed in
certain stages would be undistinguishable from lignite or brown coal;
yet both peat and lignite are known to be formed under conditions
permitting much less access of air or oxygen than occurs in the
formation of normal black soil-humus. Hence even black peat cannot at
once stand in place of soil-humus when removed from its watery bed, but
requires considerable time and aeration (oxidation), and in most cases
neutralization with lime or marl, before it can serve the purposes of
humus in the soil.</p>

<div class="blockquot fs_90">
<p>Lignite and the progressively more carbonaceous coals are and have
been formed under the conjoined action of submergence and pressure,
sometimes also aided by heat; and thus they cannot perform the function
of soil-humus, any more than the fire-clays or shales underlying them
can resume their original soil-functions without prolonged weathering.

<p><i>Amounts of Humus and Coal Formed from Vegetable
Matter.</i>—Only very general and indefinite estimates can be
given of the amount of humus or coal formed from a given quantity of
vegetable matter, since these must vary according to the conditions
under which the transformation occurs. The greater or less access of
air and of moisture, the temperature and pressure under which the
process occurs, will modify very materially the quantitative as well as
the qualitative result. In the hot arid regions the fallen leaves may
wholly disappear by oxidation on the surface of the ground, while under
humid conditions they are mostly incorporated with the surface soil. If
we assume that in the humification of plant debris (estimating their
average nitrogen content at 1%), no nitrogen is lost, it would seem
that in the humid region one part of normal soil-humus might be formed
from 5 to 6 parts of (dry) plant debris; while in the extreme regime of
the arid regions, from 18 to 20 parts of the same would be required.
But as most probably some nitrogen also is lost in the process of
humification, a considerably larger proportion of original substance
may be actually required.</p>

          log showing contraction<br> into solid lignite on drying.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot fs_90">
<p>As to coal, it is usually assumed that it requires about 8 parts of
vegetable matter for one of bituminous coal. Much higher estimates are
made by some, and an observation made by the writer at the Port Hudson
bluff, Mississippi, in 1869, would seem to justify such estimates. The
<a href="#FIG_14">above figure</a>, from a sketch made at the time, shows the proportions to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
which a pine log about eight inches in diameter had shrunk in drying
into a small sheet of lignitized wood; the original trunk, projecting
from a bed of sand some forty feet below the surface, being so porous
and spongy that when wet it flattened somewhat by its own weight; it
was connected with the little sheet of lignite by a spirally twisted,
tapering stipe.</p>

<p>Here evidently the proportion of lignite formed was a very minute
one, doubtless because of the long leaching to which the trunk had been
subjected. It thus seems impossible, as in the case of humus, to assign
any definite proportion as between woody matter and coal formed from it.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Normal humification</i> takes place only under the influence of
moderate temperature. When the temperature is too low, bacterial and
fungous growth are repressed or arrested; when too high, the fungous
vegetation assumes a different phase, the result of which is the almost
total oxidation of the organic matter, sometimes so accelerated as to
initiate rapid combustion “fire-fanging” of dung; leaving in any case
but a trifling organic residue of very high ash contents.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p><i>Eremacausis.</i>—In the absence of a sufficient degree of moisture
to co-operate with the other agencies of humification, the final
result in the soil is practically the same as in the “fire-fanging”
of dung. The organic matter is almost wholly destroyed by direct
oxidation (eremacausis) with or without the aid of minute organisms;
leaving essentially only the ash behind to be reincorporated with the
soil. This is to a very great extent the predominant process in the
arid regions of the Globe; most of the soils formed in these climates
being, therefore, very poor in humus-substances, and deriving it almost
entirely from the decay of roots only.</p>

<p>The extent to which the humus of a soil may be derived from the
vegetable debris falling or growing upon the surface, varies greatly
with the climatic conditions as well with the nature of the soil. In
the forests of humid climates with loamy soils, not only does the
autumnal leaf-fall, as well as decaying twigs and trunks, become
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
obviously incorporated with the surface soil as decay progresses on the
lower surface, but active animal agencies (see below) carry the organic
remnants bodily down. But where heavy clay soils prevail, these animal
agencies are much restricted by the compactness of the material; only a
light surface-layer of mold would be formed, and the humus of the lower
soil layers must of necessity be derived from the decay of the roots
only. This origin is claimed by Kosticheff<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
for the high content of black humus in the tchernozem or black
earth of Russia. Following Hellriegel in determining the weight of
roots contained in successive equal layers of soil from the surface
downwards, Kosticheff gives for each six inches the following data as
found in the tchernozem, taking as 100 the root-content of the surface layer:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs_90">
<p>It will be seen that there is a very close correspondence of the
humus content with the root development in the several layers, and it
seems as if though but little of the humus could be derived from the
surface growth, which is that of the grasses of the steppe.</p>

<p>The climate of the black-earth country of Russia is, though not
properly arid, yet one of rather deficient and uncertain rainfall. But
as a consequence of extremely arid conditions, and in sandy lands, it
may even happen that the immediate surface soil contains <i>less</i>
humus than what, in the farmers’ habitual parlance, would be called
the subsoil; because of the penetration of slow combustion for some
distance into the porous soils. It will then be lower down that, in the
presence of a favorable degree of moisture and lower temperature, the
conditions of normal humification are fulfilled.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
It is not always, then, that the commonly recognized distinction
between surface soil and subsoil based upon humus content can be
maintained. But the observation of everything bearing upon this point
is of the utmost importance in determining both the agricultural value
and the mode of treatment of the land.</p>

<p><i>Losses of Humus from Cultivation and Fallowing.</i>—The fact that
humus accumulates in woodlands and meadows, where no cultivation is
given, would naturally lead to the converse conclusion, viz., that
cultivation causes loss of humus and of its constituents. That this
is actually the case is recognized and widely acted upon in practice,
and there is no question that the general acceptance of stable manure
as the most widely useful fertilizer, despite its usually low content
of plant-food ingredients, is based upon the fact that it supplies
vegetable matter, in a condition highly favorable to its conversion
into humus. The most direct and cogent proof of the depletion of the
soil of both humus and nitrogen by continuous cultivation of cereal
grains has been given by Snyder,<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
who determined the loss both of humus and of nitrogen suffered by a
Minnesota soil during eight years’ continuous cultivation of wheat. The
total loss of nitrogen was 1700 pounds per acre, while only 350 pounds
were utilized by the crop; about 1400 pounds being dissipated as gas or
leached out as nitrates. A conservative estimate of the loss of humus
suffered during the same period was about a ton per acre annually,
and this loss seriously decreased not only the nitrogen-content, but
rendered the soil more compact and less retentive of moisture. But
by rotation of the wheat with clover in alternate years, very nearly
an equilibrium of both humus and nitrogen-content was obtained. In
addition, the amount of available mineral plant-food was decreased by
continuous grain culture. Ladd has made similar observations in North
Dakota, with similar results.</p>

<p>That excessive aeration results in serious losses of humus as well as
of nitrogen, is very obvious in the arid region, where it is the habit
to maintain on the surface of orchards and vineyards during the dry,
hot summers, a thick mulch of well-tilled soil, thus preventing loss of
water by evaporation. In the course of years this surface soil becomes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
so badly depleted of humus that good tilth becomes impossible, the soil
becoming light-colored and compacted; while the loss of nitrogen is
indicated by the small size of the orchard fruits. Similar losses are
of course sustained in the practice of bare summer-fallow, which at one
time was almost universal in portions of the arid region. The complete
extirpation of weed growth thus brought about, at first considered an
unmixed benefit, has ultimately had to be made up for by the practice
of green-manuring; since in the arid region the use of stable manure
encounters many difficulties.</p>

<div class="blockquot fs_90">
<p><i>Estimation of Humus in Soils.</i> It has been usual to
determine the amount of humus in soils by means of (dry or wet)
combustion, calculating the humus from the carbonic dioxid so formed,
while measuring the nitrogen gas directly. But in this process the
entire organic matter of the soil, humified and unhumified, is
indiscriminately included; and it is wholly uncertain to what extent
the latter will ultimately become humus, from the nitrification of
which plants are presumed to chiefly derive their nitrogen.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
In order to obtain definite results, the actual, functional humus must
be extracted from the soil mass by some solvent which discriminates
between the humified and unhumified organic matter. This cannot be done
by direct extraction with caustic soda or potash, which inevitably
dissolve unhumified matters and tend to expel ammonia from the humus;
besides themselves acting as humifiers (<a href="#Page_125">see this chapter, p. 125</a>.)</p>

<p><i>Grandeau Method: Matière Noire.</i>—The only method now known
which accomplishes this separation, practically excluding the
unhumified while fully dissolving the humified matter—is that of
<i>Grandeau</i>: the extraction of the soil, first with dilute acid,
in order to set the humic substances free from their combinations with
lime and magnesia; and their subsequent extraction with moderately
dilute solutions of ammonia (or other alkali hydrates). Upon the
evaporation of the ammonia solution the humus is left behind in the
form of a black lustrous substance (“matière noire” of Grandeau) much
resembling the crust of soot formed in flues from wood fires. As
it contains a variable amount of ash, it must be burnt and the ash
subtracted from the first weight.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
<i>Amounts of Humus in Soils.</i>—While in peat, marsh and muck
lands the humus-content may rise above twenty per cent, in ordinary
cultivated lands it rarely exceeds about five per cent, and very
commonly falls below three per cent, even in the humid regions. In
properly arid soils we find a very much lower average, rarely exceeding
one per cent, and frequently falling to .30 and even less. This
scarcity of humus manifests itself plainly in the prevalently light
gray tint of the arid soils.</p>

<p>Meadows and woodlands generally show the highest humus-content in their
surface soils, gradually increasing while in that condition; while when
taken into cultivation the humus-content gradually decreases, owing
to the free aeration and consequent “burning-out” caused by tillage.
Hence the humus must be from time to time replaced by the use of stable
manure, or green-manure crops, to prevent injurious changes in the
tilling qualities of the land. Not only humus as such, but according to
Schloesing also the insoluble colloid humates, produce in the soil a
loosening effect or tilth (Germ. Bodengare), which apparently cannot be
brought about by any other substance.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p><i>Humates and Ulmates.</i>—That the insoluble humates of lime,
magnesia, iron, manganese and alumina are present in most soils is
conclusively shown by the composition of the solution obtained by the
extraction of soils with weak acid, as above mentioned in connection
with the quantitative determination of humus according to Grandeau;
since these bases are almost always extracted by the weak acid. When
the brown solution of alkali humate obtained in this process is
carefully neutralized with sulfuric or hydrochloric acid, or is mixed
with solutions of the above bases, flocculent, insoluble precipitates
are formed, while the solution is discolored. Similar precipitates may
be obtained with other metallic solutions, notably with that of copper,
which precipitates the humus-acids most completely. Doubtless these
compounds contribute greatly to the conservation of the humus-content
of soils, protecting it to a certain extent from oxidation, and also
preventing excessive acidity. The brown tint of certain subsoils in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
northern humid regions have been shown by Tollens and others to be due
not to ferric hydrate, as had been supposed, but to calcic, magnesic
and aluminic humates. <i>None of the mineral bases or acids present can
be detected in the humic solution by the usual reagents.</i></p>

<p><i>Mineral Ingredients in Humus.</i>—That the mineral plant-food
ingredients present in the humus extracted by the Grandeau process,
and which remain as ash when the matière noire is burned, are capable
of nourishing plant growth, was directly shown by Grandeau, Snyder
and others. The former was inclined to consider that those substances
were mainly thus taken up by plants, under natural conditions. This
theory, however, has not been sustained by subsequent investigations;
the mineral plant-food thus extracted is not a measure of the immediate
productiveness of the soils, as demonstrated by Snyder, and the
residual soils are not sterile. It is also still doubtful to what
extent the mineral bases and acids are <i>naturally</i> combined with
the humus-substances, it being contended by some that they are brought
into organic combination by the acid and ammonia extraction. The
investigations of Snyder and Ladd, above referred to, prove however to
some extent at least that the humus-substances are naturally combined
with them, and that probably they are largely made available to plants
through the direct and indirect action of the humus compounds. This
subject is farther considered in <a href="#Page_340">chapter 19</a>.</p>

<p>The nature and amounts of these mineral substances are well exemplified
in the subjoined full analysis by Snyder, of the ash of the humus and
humates extracted from a compound sample of prairie soils of Minnesota,
which had been thrown down from the ammonia solution by simply
neutralizing the liquid:<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

The large amounts of the soluble alkalies potash and soda thrown
down with the humic matters are very striking, as is the very large
proportion of phosphoric acid. Lime and magnesia had, of course, been
mainly eliminated by the preliminary acid treatment.</p>

<p><i>Functions of the Unhumified Organic Matter.</i>—The unhumified
plant debris in the soil are not to be regarded as useless, even
aside from their potential conversion into active humus. Not only
do these remnants of vegetation lighten the soil, rendering it more
pervious to air and water, but in their progressive decay they give off
carbonic gas, which is active in soil-decomposition; and they serve as
nourishment to the soil bacteria upon which its thriftiness so greatly
depends. <a href="#Page_142">See below, chapter 9</a>.</p>

<p><i>The Nitrogen-Content of Humus.</i>—Since soil-humus is doubtless
the chief depository of soil-nitrogen, and the main source from
which, through the process of nitrification, the nitrogen-supply to
plants is usually derived, its content of that element is a matter of
great interest. It has been customary to estimate approximately the
nitrogen-content of soils by the proportion of humus-substance present;
and as the light tints of the soils of the arid region indicate a small
humus-content, a scarcity of nitrogen seemed to be also indicated
for these lands. As this in a number of cases did not seem to accord
with actual experience, an investigation of the subject was made at
the California experiment station,<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
with the results shown in the subjoined table. In considering these
results it must be kept in mind that while arid conditions can rarely
be fulfilled in the humid region, humid conditions are quite frequently
locally represented in the arid, in lowlands and on high mountains;
while moderately moist benchlands represent the semi-arid regime.

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
It thus appears that on the average the humus of the arid soils
contains about three and a half times as much nitrogen as that of the
humid; that in the extreme cases, the difference goes as high as over
six to one (see Nos. 37 and 704); and that in the latter cases, the
nitrogen-percentage in the arid humus considerably exceeds that of the
albuminoid group, the flesh-forming substances.</p>

<p>It thus becomes intelligible that in the arid region a humus-percentage
which under humid conditions would justly be considered entirely
inadequate for the success of normal crops, may nevertheless suffice
even for the more exacting ones. This is more clearly seen on
inspection of the figures in the third column, which represent the
product resulting from the multiplication of the humus-percentage of
the soil into the nitrogen-percentage of its humus; as appears in
comparing the respective averages, or Nos. 1167 and 110 and others. An
additional consideration is the probable greater ease with which the
nitrifying bacteria can act upon a material so rich in nitrogen.</p>

<p>We must not, then, be misled by the smallness of many humus-percentages
in the arid region, into an assumption of a deficiency in the supply of
soil-nitrogen.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90"><i>Decrease of Nitrogen-Content in Humus
with Depth.</i>—Since the oxidation of the carbon and hydrogen
in the humus-substance, and the consequent increase of its relative
nitrogen-content, are manifestly dependent upon the presence of air
and heat, it is reasonably to be expected that the nitrogen-percentage
of the humus should decrease with the depth of the soil. That this is
really the case is plainly shown in the subjoined table, which gives
the humus-percentages and the nitrogen-content of the humus from
the surface foot down to twelve feet, in a soil on the bench of the
Russian River, Cal., which is sub-irrigated, and liable to more or
less rainfall during the summer. It will be seen that not only does
the absolute humus-percentage decrease quite regularly down to seven
feet, at which point there evidently was at one time a strong root
development, causing a notable increase of the humus-content; from
which again there is a regular decrease down to the twelfth foot. It
will be noted that the nitrogen-percentage in the humus, while not
decreasing with the same regularity as the humus-content itself, yet
exhibits a general recession from 5.30 to 1.15 in the ninth foot, to
which direct oxidation doubtless never penetrates.</p>

<p>While it may be questioned whether the process of humification had in
these materials really reached the point of sensible completion in all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
cases (notably in those of sawdust and cow manure), the great
variability of the products from different materials is very striking.
When the nitrogen-content is deducted the percentage composition of
the products agrees more nearly. Considering that the nitrogen is
probably present in the amid form, it is natural that hydrogen should
in a measure vary with it, as in the case of the clover, flour and
meat humus. Nitrogen being the most variable ingredient of humus, it
seems probable that the variation of the proportion of the humus-amids
present is the most potent factor in the variability of the composition
of natural soil-humus.</p>

<p>Arranging these results in the order of their nitrogen-content as in
the table below, we see that the latter approximately corresponds to
the original protein-content of the humified substances.</p>

<p>While the above data prove the correlation between the first products
of humification and the original substance, it must be remembered
that subsequently, under proper conditions, the nitrogen-percentage
in humus may, in the course of time, increase very greatly, even to a
proportion considerably above that contained in flesh itself. When we
consider that ordinarily, the latter, and the albuminoid substances
generally, decompose in contact with air with an abundant evolution
of ammonia compounds, sometimes leaving only a little fat (adipocere)
behind, it is surprising that the decomposition <i>within</i> the soil
should have exactly the opposite result, viz., an <i>accumulation</i>
of the nitrogen. The causes of this marked difference are not yet well
understood, but it is probably due to the differences in the kinds of
bacteria that are active in the two cases.</p>

<p>Snyder has also shown that the richer the organic matter humified is
in nitrogen, the more energetically it acts in rendering available the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
mineral matters of the soil for plant nutrition. Correspondingly,
Ladd<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
has shown that with the increase of humus in the soil, there is also a
corresponding increase in the amounts of mineral plant-food extracted
from the soil by a four per cent solution of ammonia, such as is
employed in the Grandeau method of humus-determination.</p>

<h4>MICRO-ORGANISMS OF THE SOIL.</h4>

<p>Intimately correlated with the humus-substances of the soil, as well
as with its temporary contents of the carbohydrates (cellulose, gums
and sugars) from which humus is formed, is the multitudinous flora of
micro-organisms always present and exercising important functions in
connection with the growth of the higher plants. Extended researches
by Adametz, Schloesing and Müntz, Miquel, Koch, Fraenkel, Winogradsky,
Frank and many others, have thrown light upon the immense numbers and
great variety of minute organisms, especially of the bacterial group,
present in soils, and upon their distribution and activities in the
same. It has been shown that their numbers are greatest near (although
usually not at) the surface, decreasing rapidly downward and generally
disappearing wholly at depths between seven and eight feet; the latter
depth varying of course according to the nature and porosity of the
soil, and both depth and numbers being greatest in summer.</p>

<p><i>Numbers of Bacteria in Soils.</i>—Adametz found in one gram of
soil, 38,000 bacteria at the surface, 460,000 at ten inches depth; in
a loam soil at the surface 500,000, at ten inches 464,000 in each gram
of earth. Of mould and similar fungous germs there were only 40 to 50
in the same, 6 species being true molds, while four were ferments,
including the yeasts of wine and beer. Fraenkel found in virgin land
from near Potsdam, a sudden, marked decrease at depths of from three
to five feet; while in earth from inhabited places within the city of
Berlin, considerable numbers were still present at eight and even ten
feet, in some cases.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span></p>

<p>In the researches lately made by Hohl at the bacteriological
station at Liebefeld, near Bern, it was found that in cultivated
soils the number of bacteria greatly exceeds the figures given
by Fraenkel. He found a gram of moist soil to contain from
three to fifteen millions of bacteria. In the cultivated soil of
Liebefeld he found 5,750,000, in meadow land 9,400,000, in a
manure pile 44,500,000 per cubic centimeter. These figures
seem high for so small a quantity of material, but taking the
average size of a bacterium, a cubic centimeter might readily
contain six hundred millions. (Grandeau, Ann. Sci. Agronomique,
vol. 1, p. 461, 1905).</p>

<div class="blockquot fs_90">
<p>Mayo and Kinsley (Rep. Kansas Exp’t Station
for 1902-3) have made elaborate investigations of the numbers and
kinds of bacteria found in various soils in Kansas, in connection with
different crops. It is noteworthy that in most cases their figures
exceed considerably those given by European observers, as they often
reach high into the millions, in one case to over fifty millions, per
cubic centimeter.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>Five fields with different soils were investigated; the land

considerable humus; field No. 2 is similar to field 1 but contains more
humus; field No. 3 is a thin soil with clay gumbo subsoil; fields Nos.
4 and 5 are black loams, but not as rich in humus as either No. 1 or
No. 2.”</p>

<p>“The crop records of these fields for the past ten years indicate
that the crop yield has been (more or less?) directly proportional to

<p>Unfortunately no chemical analyses of any of these soils are <span
class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>

communicated; but at the request of the writer samples of the soils
of the first three fields were sent from the Kansas station for humus
determinations (courteously made by Dr. H. C. Myers), which gave the
following results:</p>

<p>While these humus-percentages are not directly proportional to the
bacterial content, a favoring effect of high humus-content is clearly
shown. The bacterial and the humus-content of these soils are sensibly,
even if not directly, correlated; which might reasonably be expected,
since the organic matter and the humus are the bacterial food.</p>

<p>The investigation also showed wide differences in the bacterial
content of the same soil when different crops were growing on it. Thus
in samples taken on Aug. 15, there were found in the first twelve
inches of a black loam soil bearing timothy and clover, 1,380,000,
in the same with alfalfa and clover, 21,091,000, with maize from one
to over two millions. In soils from the western part of Kansas, the
bacterial content of the same crops was much less (as doubtless is the
humus-content), and it is noteworthy that the prairie buffalo grass
shows throughout a relatively high bacterial content in the first foot
of the soil, ranging next to alfalfa. The root bacteria living on the
legumes will naturally increase the bacterial content of the soils on
which they grow, more than plants which, like maize, do not directly
utilize bacterial action.</p>

<p><i>Multiplication of the Bacteria.</i>—Marshall Ward and Duclaux
have made some special observations in regard to the rapidity with
which certain bacteria multiply. Duclaux summarizes the final
conclusion thus: taking as a basis the time of 35 minutes for the
subdivision into two, which has been frequently observed by Ward, there
would be four millions of bacteria produced in twelve hours. The first
filaments had plenty of room in a drop culture of one cubic millimeter;
but at the end their total volume amounted to the tenth part of the
total volume of the drop. At the above rate, making 48 generations in
24 hours, 281,500 billions of organisms would be produced. (Grandeau,
Ann. Sci. Agron. Vol. 1, 1905, p. 456).</p>
</div>

<p><i>Aerobic and Anaerobic Bacteria.</i>—As may readily be inferred,
the cultural and other surface conditions exert a potent influence
both upon the kinds and abundance of the bacteria and molds; since the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
life-functions of some are dependent upon the presence of free oxygen
(“aerobic”), while others flourish best, or only, in the absence of
air (“anaerobic”), or are able to avail themselves of the presence of
<i>combined</i> oxygen, by reduction of oxids present. Their number is
found, in general, to be greatest in cultivated lands, and bacteria
are there by far predominant over the moulds. On the other hand, the
moulds gain precedence in woodlands and meadows, at least so far as air
can gain access; while in the deeper layers of the same, as well as in
peaty lands, bacterial life is always scanty. This holds particularly
in respect to the nitrifying organisms, and others whose life-functions
are dependent upon abundant access of oxygen (aerobic).</p>

<p><i>Food Material Required.</i>—All bacteria, like the fungi, are
dependent for their development upon the presence of adequate amounts
of some organic food-material, best apparently in water-soluble form.
In the soil it seems to be chiefly compounds of the carbohydrate group,
especially various gums derived from the decaying plant substance, or
from stable manure; in artificial cultures, glucose is mostly found
to be a highly available food. When the decaying substance reaches
the state of humus, the latter seems to be available as food only to
comparatively few bacteria. The very abundant development of bacterial
life seems to be among the most important effects produced by stable
manure upon the surface soil, in establishing good tilth (“Bodengare”
in German).</p>

<p><i>Functions of the Bacteria.</i>—While there is still much
uncertainty as to the exact functions performed by most of these
bacteria in respect to soil-formation and plant growth, there are
several kinds whose activity has been proved to be of the utmost
importance in one or both directions; it having been shown that when
the soil is sterilized either by heat or antiseptic agents, certain
essential processes are completely suppressed until the soil is
re-infected and the conditions of bacterial life restored.</p>

<p>Probably the chief in importance are those connected with the processes
of <i>nitrification</i> and <i>denitrification</i>, bearing as they do
upon the supply to plants of the most costly of the three substances
furnished by fertilizers. These organisms have been first extensively
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
studied by Winogradsky, while the conditions of their activity have
been largely developed by R. Warington.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p><i>Nitrifying Bacteria.</i>—The conversion of ammonia into nitrates
is accomplished under proper conditions by two organisms, or groups
of organisms; the first stage being the formation of nitrites
by the round, often flagellate cells of <i>nitrosomonas</i> (or
nitrosococcus). The second, the oxidation of the nitrites into nitrates
by very minute rod-shaped bacilli, named <i>nitrobacteria</i>. The
conditions under which these bacteria can act are quite definite in
that, aside from a supply of the nitrifiable substance, a fairly high
temperature (24° C. or 75° F.) and a moderate degree of moisture,
there must be a free access of oxygen (air); and there must be present
a base (or its carbonate) with which the acids formed by oxidation
can immediately unite. In an acid medium (“sour” soils) nitrification
promptly ceases; as it also does whenever the amount of base present
has been fully neutralized. The bases most favorable to nitrification
are lime and magnesia in the form of carbonates, an excess of which
does no harm; while in the case of the carbonates of potash and soda,
the amount must be strictly limited.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90"><i>Conditions of Activity.</i>—Dumont and
Crochetelle found that up to .25 per cent, potassic carbonate acted
favorably on the process; which was, however, completely stopped by as
much as .8 per ct. Warington has shown that ammonic carbonate similarly
prevents nitrification when exceeding about .37 per ct. Ammonia salts
in general appear to be antagonistic to the transformation of nitrites
into nitrates.</p>

<p>Aside from the carbonates, some neutral salts favor nitrification very
markedly; while others tend to depress it. Deherain found that .5 per
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
cent of common salt suffices to prevent nitrification altogether, while
smaller amounts retard it proportionally. According to Dumont and
Crochetelle, potassium chlorid acts favorably up to .3 per cent, but at
.8 per cent suppresses nitrification. Earthy and alkaline sulfates, on
the contrary, seem to act favorably throughout, at least up to .5 per
cent. This is especially true of gypsum, which, according to Pichard,
accelerates the process more than any other substance known. Taking
the effect of gypsum as the maximum, he found that, other things being
equal, the amounts of nitrates formed were as shown in the table below,
the effect of gypsum being taken as 100:</p>

<table class="spb1">
   <tbody><tr>
      <td class="tdl">Gypsum</td>
      <td class="tdr">100&#8199;&#8199;</td>

      <td class="tdr">12.5</td>
   </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">The above estimates are markedly confirmed
by the observations of the writer in the alkali soils of California. In
these, nitrates exist most abundantly when the salts contained in the
soil are mainly sulfates; while wherever common salt or sodic carbonate
are present in considerable amounts, the amounts of nitrate found are
notably less. In saline seashore lands nitrates are usually present in
traces only. Wollny has moreover shown that the nitrates themselves
exert a repressive influence on nitrification.</p>

<p><i>Effects of Aeration and Reduction.</i>—While the fostering effect
of sulfates upon nitrification is very energetic in well aerated soils,
they become injurious whenever by a reductive process in ill-drained
lands, the sulfates are reduced to sulfids. Under such conditions
the process will in any case be much impaired. On the other hand,
the favoring effect of abundant aeration was strikingly shown in
the experiment made by Deherain, in which a cubic meter of soil was
left unmoved for several months, while a similar mass was thoroughly
agitated once a week during the same time. The proportion of nitrates
formed in the latter case was as 70 to 1 formed in the quiescent soil
mass. It follows that the intensity of nitrification is essentially
dependent upon the porosity of the soil; and that it is thus greatly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
favored in the pervious soil-strata of the arid regions. It also
follows that thorough and frequent tillage and fallowing greatly favor
nitrification; thus explaining one of the beneficial results of these
operations. At the same time, it is true that we may thus in a short
time seriously diminish the reserve stock of nitrogen contained in the
soil in the form of humus-amids; and since nitrates are exceedingly
liable to be lost from the soil in several ways, such excessive
nitrification is to be avoided.</p>

<p><i>Unhumified Organic Matter does not Nitrify.</i>—There can be little
doubt that the formation of ammonia from the amido-compounds in humus
is also the work of bacteria; but this, really the initial phase of the
nitrogen-nutrition of plants, has not yet been fully elucidated. That,
however, it is essentially only the ready-formed humus and not the
unhumified debris of the soil which participate in nitrification was
shown by the experiments of the writer, <a href="#Page_340">see chapter 19</a>.</p>

<div class="figleft">
    <img id="FIG_17" src="images/image148.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="209" >
    <p class="blockquot f90"><span class="smcap">Fig. 17.</span>—Bacillus<br>
         denitrificans I.<br> (Burri.)</p>
</div>

<p><i>Denitrifying Bacteria.</i>—Among the sources of <i>loss of
nitrates</i> in the soil is the action of denitrifying bacteria;
some of which cause merely the reduction of nitrates to nitrites and
progressively to ammonia, while others cause gaseous nitrogen to be
given off from nitrites and nitrates, resulting in their complete loss
to the soil. While there are probably several kinds of the latter
class, the most rapidly effective is an organism contained abundantly
in fresh horse dung, and also on the surface of old straw. This can
readily be shown by subjecting a very dilute solution (1-3 per cent.)
of Chile saltpeter to the action of fresh horse dung in a close flask,
when nitrogen and carbonic dioxid gases are evolved, and in a few days
the nitrate has totally disappeared. In the course of time this power
of horse-manure disappears; so that “rotted manure” is practically
free from it and under proper conditions serves nitrification so
effectively, that in the past it has served extensively for the
production of saltpeter in the “niter-plantations” for the industrial
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
purposes; the material of which was loose earth, marl and manure,
kept moist and frequently forked over for better aeration. Saltpeter
is similarly produced in stables, corroding the mortar of brick
foundations. Nevertheless, it is necessary to avoid the use, either
together or at short intervals apart, of Chile saltpeter and fresh
manure; the manure if used first should be allowed to remain at least
two months in the soil before saltpeter is applied.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">The reduction of nitrates to nitrites
and ammonia is brought about by quite a number of bacteria, mostly
anaerobic, and such as consume combined oxygen in their development.
Thus the butyric ferment, which in the absence of readily reducible
compounds evolves free hydrogen, will in presence of nitrates reduce
the latter to nitrites, or form ammonia by addition of hydrogen to
nitrogen just set free by reduction. Such reductive processes of course
occur chiefly in soils rich in organic matter, or ill-aerated. The
ammonia so formed, while at first simply combining with any humus acids
present, may in the course of time be itself reduced to the amidic
condition, being thereby rendered relatively inert, until again brought
into action by ammonia-forming bacteria.</p>

<p><i>Ammonia-forming Bacteria.</i>—A large number of different bacteria
appear to be concerned in the formation of ammonia from compounds of
the albuminoid group, (and probably from humus). Among these is one of
the most common in soils (<i>Bacillus mycoides</i>, root bacillus),
which while forming ammonia carbonate in solutions of albumen, is also
capable of reducing nitrates to nitrites and ammonia in presence of a
nutritive solution of sugar.</p>

<p>The “hay bacillus” (<i>B. subtilis</i>), so abundantly developed in
hay infusions, and one of the most abundant in cultivated soils,
has together with B. ellenbachensis, B. megatherium, B. mycoides,
and others, by some been credited with important action in favoring
vegetation; so that a fairly pure culture of B. ellenbachensis has
been brought out commercially in Germany under the name of “Alinit.”
Rigorous culture experiments made by Stutzer and others have, however,
failed to show any general benefit from the use of alinit in infecting
either land or seeds. But there is no doubt of the <i>Effects of
Bacterial Life on Physical Soil Conditions.</i>—It is apparent that
all conditions favoring the life of aerobic (air-needing)
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span> bacteria
tend also to produce the loose, porous state (tilth) of the surface
soil so conducive to the welfare of culture plants, designated by
German agriculturists as “Bodengare.” Whether or not this condition is
directly due to bacterial processes, as is thought by Stutzer (Landw.
Presse, 1904, No. 11) it is assuredly a highly important point to
be gained, and is essentially connected with the presence of humus
in adequate amounts, which is also a favoring condition of abundant
bacterial life. It seems that the preference given to the shallow
putting-in, or even surface application of stable manure, existing in
Europe, is largely based upon the marked effect upon the looseness of
the surface soil, generally credited to the physical effect of the
manure substance itself, but apparently largely due to the intensity of
bacterial action thus brought about.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Root-bacteria or rhizobia of legumes.</span>—Among the
most important bacteria, agriculturally, is that which enables plants of the
leguminous order—(peas, beans, vetches, clovers, lupins, etc.),—to
obtain their supply of nitrogen from the air independently of those
contained in the soil. The source of nitrogen to plants was long a
disputed question; it was at first supposed (by de Saussure) that it
was obtained directly from the soil by the absorption of humus; but
this was disproved, and Liebig then contended that it was derived
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
directly from the atmosphere through the ammonia in rain water. This
was then shown to be wholly inadequate; and Boussingault proved
conclusively that plants do not take up nitrogen gas from the air.
This was subsequently denied by Ville; but investigation at the
Rothamstead agricultural station by Lawes and Gilbert definitely
confirmed Boussingault’s results. At the same time they also proved
very definitely that while grass and root crops deplete the soil
of nitrogen, clover and other leguminous crops leave in the soil
more nitrogen than was previously present, even when the entire,
itself highly nitrogenous, leguminous crop is removed from the land.
The improvement of lands for wheat production by rotation with
clover had long ago become a practical maxim; but the cause was not
understood until, in 1888, Hellriegel and Wilfarth announced that the
variously-shaped excrescences or tubercles which had long been observed
as frequently deforming the roots of legumes, are caused by the attacks
of bacilli capable of absorbing the free nitrogen of the air and thus
enabling the host-plant to acquire its needed supply by absorbing
the richly nitrogenous matter thus accumulated in the excrescences.
The minute rod-shaped organism was named <i>Bacillus radicicola</i>
by Beyerinck; <i>Rhizobium leguminosarum</i>, by A. Frank, who has
published an extensive treatise on the subject.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>Microscopic examination of the nodules shows their tissues to contain
partly motile, free bacteria, partly others (bacteroids), which have
assumed a quiescent condition, and are of much greater dimensions than
those of the motile form. These relatively thick, and sometimes forked,
forms, differing somewhat in each of the group adaptations mentioned
below, constitute the bulk of the cell-contents of the nodules, and
ultimately serve for the nutrition of the host-plant with nitrogen.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
When the growth of the excrescence is completed, the swollen, quiescent
bacteroids gradually collapse and become depleted of their
nitrogenous substance; and finally the apparently empty husk remains
or drops off, carrying with it the minute cocci which in the soil
become active bacteria again. The nodules are thus found mainly on
the actively-growing roots, and at the time when vegetation and
assimilation are most active in the plant. In autumn, or when the
plants are in fruit, the roots may be wholly destitute of nodules.</p>

<p>The adhesion of the nodules to the roots is mostly very loose, and
their falling-off when the seedlings are carelessly transplanted,
doubtless accounts for much of the difficulty generally found in
transplanting legumes when once established.</p>

<p>The figures annexed show the various forms assumed by the nodules
in different plants, and with them also the corresponding forms of
the bacteroids of each. The latter, here shown magnified about 1000

bacteroids are quite as much varied as are those of the nodules they form.

<i>Varieties of Forms.</i>—While these bacilli seem to be normally
present in most soils, it seems to be necessary that they should
adapt themselves for this symbiosis<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
with each of several groups of the legumes in order to exert their most
beneficial effects. In many soils there appears to exist a “neutral
form”, which requires about a season’s time or more to adapt itself
specially to the several leguminous groups so that a great advantage is
gained by infecting either the seeds or the soil with the forms already
adapted, when no similar plant has lately occupied the same ground.
Thus the bacillus of the clover root is of little or no benefit to
beans, peas or alfalfa, and the root-bacilli of each of the latter are
relatively ineffectual when used to infect either of the other groups.
The same is true of the bacilli of lupins and of acacias, as applied to
leguminous plants of any other groups.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p><i>Mode of Infection.</i>—The infection is especially effectual when
applied to the seeds before sowing; and for that purpose there may be
used either the turbid water made by stirring up in it some earth of a
properly infected field, or else water charged with a pure culture of
the appropriate kind, commercially known under the name of nitragin,
now manufactured for the purpose. Or else, the field to be sown may
be infected by spreading on it broadcast, <i>and promptly harrowing
in</i>, a wagon-load of earth per acre from a properly infected field.
Such earth must not be allowed to dry, or to be long exposed to light.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">Specially effective (“virulent”) and hardy
forms of such bacteria have been produced under artificial culture by
Dr. Geo. T. Moore of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. These cultures
can be sent by mail on cotton imbued with them, for the infection of
seeds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
It is very important that the bacillus should be present in the
<i>earliest</i> stages of the growth of the seedlings; otherwise the
latter will undergo a longer or shorter period of starvation, unless
the soil contains, or is furnished with, a sufficiency of available
nitrogen to supply their immediate wants. When such a supply is very
abundant, the legume crop will sometimes develop no nodules at all; but
the best crops appear to be the result of a thorough infection, and
abundant formation of the excrescences.</p>

<p><i>Cultural Results.</i>—The marked results obtained in certain soils
by inoculation with the legume-root bacillus are exemplified in the
following table, showing results of experiments by J. F. Duggar, at the
Alabama Experiment station.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>Such marked <i>increases</i> from soil inoculation cannot of course be
expected in cases where the soil has previously borne leguminous crops
of similar nature and therefore already contains the root bacteria.
Hence Duggar found no increase of production when inoculating for
cowpea, land that had borne that crop two years before and already
contained the root bacteria. In the arid region, where the almost
universally calcareous soils usually bear a natural growth largely
composed of various leguminous plants, inoculation is likely to be less
commonly effective than in the humid region east of the Mississippi, where
leguminous plants are much less generally present in the native flora.</p>

<p>The distinctive agricultural function of supplying nitrogen to the
soils on which they grow, renders inexcusable the persistence of some
writers and teachers in designating all forage plants as “grasses.”
Whatever excuse there may have been for this practice so long as the
nitrogen-gathering function of the legumes was unknown, disappears with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
this discovery, and the misleading misnomer should be banished from
agricultural publications and lectures, at the very least.</p>

<p><i>Other Nitrogen-Absorbing Bacteria.</i>—An increase in the
nitrogen-content of some soils, aside from the action of leguminous
root-bacteria, has long been observed. As already stated, this increase
was at first ascribed to certain green algæ often seen to develop on
the soil surface; but it has now been shown that the nitrogen-gathering
function belongs to at least two bacteria, one of which (<i>Clostridium
pastorianum</i>) was discovered by Winogradski, the other
(<i>Azotobacter chroococcum</i>) by Beyerinck, and has since been
farther investigated by Koch, Kröber, Gerlach and Vogel, and last by
Lipman and Hugo Fischer. According to the latter it seems likely that
Azotobacter chroococcum lives in symbiosis with the green algæ, all of
which, like the Azotobacter itself, develop with special luxuriance on
calcareous soils.</p>

<div class="blockquot fs_90">
<p>Lipman (Rep. Agr. Exp’t Station, New Jersey, 1903 and 1904)
describes as <i>Azotobacter vinelandii</i> a form somewhat different
from the A. chroococcum, the nitrogen-assimilating power of which he
tested quite elaborately. He exposed to air pure cultures of <i>A.
vinelandii</i> in nutritive solution containing the proper mineral
ingredients, and glucose 20 grams per liter. 100 cub. centimeters
of this solution was exposed in flasks of respectively 250, 500 and
1000 cc. content, therefore having greater surface in the larger
flasks. After ten days, the amounts of nitrogen fixed were found to be
respectively 1.67, 3.19 and 7.90 milligrams. When mannite solution was
employed instead of glucose, a similar fixation was observed; and it
was also shown that the presence of combined nitrogen in the forms of
nitrates or ammonium salts discouraged the fixation by the bacillus.</p>

<p>It was thus clearly proved that <i>A. vinelandii</i> at least
does not need symbiosis with algæ to fix atmospheric nitrogen; but
experiments with mixed cultures of the above bacillus and another
(designated as No. 30 by Lipman) proved that when these two co-operate
the absorption of atmospheric nitrogen is nearly doubled. As it is
probable that this is the case also with other soil bacteria, the
importance of this source of nitrogen to plants is obvious; provided of
course that the proper nutritive ingredients are present in available
form. Lipman shows that among the organic nutrients, besides the
sugars, glycerine and the salts of propionic and lactic acids, and
probably also others of the same groups, can serve as nourishment to
the nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p>

<h4>DISTRIBUTION OF THE HUMUS<br> WITHIN THE SURFACE SOIL.</h4>

<p>The uniform distribution of the humus-contents of the surface soil, as
shown in sections of the same, is by no means easily accounted for.
The roots from which its substance is so largely derived are not so
universally distributed as to account for it; but least of all can the
rapid disappearance of the leaf-fall and other vegetable offal from
the surface be accounted for without some outside agencies. Of these,
the action of fungous vegetation, and of insects and earthworms, are
doubtless the chief ones.</p>

<p><i>Fungi.</i>—When we examine a decaying root, we find radiating from
it a zone of deeper tint, as though from a colored solution penetrating
outward. But since under normal conditions humus is insoluble, this
explanation cannot stand. Microscopic examination, however, reveals
that the outside limit of this zone is also the limit to which the
fungous fibrils concerned in the process extend; and as these fibrils
are much more finely distributed and much more numerous than the
roots of any plant, it is natural that the humus resulting from
their decomposition should be more evenly distributed than the roots
themselves.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>Such fungous growth is not, however, confined to dead and decaying
roots only. A large number of trees and shrubs, among them pines and
firs, beeches, aspen and many others, also the heaths, and woody plants
associated with them, appear to depend largely for their healthy
development, notably in northern latitudes, upon the co-operation
(“symbiosis”) of fungous fibrils that “infest” their roots, enabling
them to assimilate, indirectly, the decaying organic (and inorganic)
matter which would otherwise be unavailable, and at the same time
converting that matter into their own substance. Fungous growths thus
mediate both the decomposition and rehabilitation of the vegetable debris.</p>

<p>The vegetative fibrils (mycelia) of several kinds of molds are
constantly present in the soil, and while consuming the dead tissue of
the higher plants, spread their own substance throughout the soil mass.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
The same is true of the subterranean or “root” mycelia of the larger
fungi, toadstools, mushrooms, which are commonly found about dead
stumps and other deposits of decaying vegetable and animal offal.
All these being dependent upon the presence of air for their life
functions, remain within such distance from the surface as will afford
adequate aeration; the depth reached depending upon the perviousness of
the soil and subsoil. In the humid region this will usually be within
a foot of the surface, but in the arid may reach to several feet.
Ultimately these organisms contribute their substance to the store of
humus in the land.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">On the surface of moist soils we frequently
find a copious growth of green fibrils, which may be either those of
algæ, such as Oscillaria, or the early stages (prothallia) of moss
vegetation. This vegetation has been credited with absorption of
nitrogen from the air, thus enriching the soil; but later researches
have shown this effect to be due to symbiotic bacteria
(<a href="#Page_156">see above p. 156</a>).</p>

<p><i>Animal Agencies.</i>—Darwin first suggested that wherever the
common earthworm (<i>Lumbricus</i>) finds the conditions of existence,
it exerts a most important influence in the formation of the humous
surface-soil layer; and the limitation imposed upon these conditions by
the subsoil has doubtless a great deal to do with the sharp demarcation
we often find between it and the surface soil. Briefly stated, the
earthworm nourishes itself by swallowing, successively, portions of
the surrounding earth, digesting a part of its organic matter and then
ejecting the undigested earth in the form of “casts,” such as may
be seen by thousands on the surface of the ground during or after a
rain. Darwin (The Formation of Vegetable Mold, 1881), has calculated
from actual observation that in humid climates and in a ground fairly
stocked with these worms, the soil thus brought up may amount to from
one-tenth to two-tenths of an inch annually over the entire surface;
so that in half a century the entire surface foot might have been
thus worked over. Aside from the mechanical effect thus achieved in
loosening the soil, and the access of air and water permitted by their
burrows, the chemical effects resulting from their digestive process,
and the final return of their own substance to the soil mass; also their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
habit of drawing after themselves into their burrows leafstalks, blades
of grass and other vegetable remains, renders their work of no mean
importance both from the physical and chemical point of view. The
uniformity, lack of structure and loose texture of the surface soil,
especially of forests, as compared with subsoil layers of corresponding
thickness, is doubtless largely due to the earthworms’ work. It has
frequently been observed that when an unusual overflow has drowned out
the earthworm population of a considerable area, the surface soil layer
remains compacted, and vegetation languishes, until new immigration
has restocked the soil with them. Again, the humus formed under their
influence is always neutral, never acid.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">Wollny (Forsch, Agr., 1890, p. 382), has
shown by direct experimental cultures in boxes, with and without
earthworms, surprising differences between the cultural results
obtained, and this has been fully confirmed by the subsequent
researches of Djemil (Ber. Physiol. Lab. Vers. Halle, 1898). In
Wollny’s experiments, the ratio of higher production in the presence
of the worms, varied all the way from 2.6 per cent in the case of
oats, 93.9 in that of rye, 135.9 in that of potatoes, 300 in that of
the field pea, and 140 in that of the vetch, to 733 per cent in the
case of rape. Wollny attributes these favorable effects in the main
to the increased looseness, and perviousness of the soil to air, and
diminished water-holding power. Djemil’s results all point in the same
direction; and he shows, moreover, that the allegation that the roots
penetrate more deeply in the presence of the worms by following their
burrows, is unfounded, the descending roots often passing close to and
outside of these.</p>

<p>The work of earthworms is especially effective in loamy soils and in
the humid regions. In the arid region, and in sandy soils generally,
the life-conditions are unfavorable to the worm, and the perviousness
elsewhere brought about by its labors already exists naturally in most
cases. It is stated by E. T. Seton (Century Mag. for June, 1904) that
the earthworm is practically non-existent in the arid region between
the Rocky Mountains and the immediate Pacific coast, from Manitoba to
Texas. In the Pacific coast region, however, they are abundant, and do
their work effectually.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span></p>

<p><i>Insects</i> of various kinds are also instrumental in producing, not
only the uniform distribution of humus in the surface soil, but also
the looseness of texture which we see in forest soils especially. Ants,
wasps, many kinds of beetles, crickets, and particularly the larvæ
of these, and of other burrowing creatures, often form considerable
accumulations, due directly both to their mechanical activity, and to
their excrements.</p>

<p>The work of <i>ants</i> is in some regions on so large a scale as to
attract the attention of the most casual observer. Especially is this
the case in portions of the arid region, from Texas to Montana, where
at times large areas are so thickly studded with hills from three to
twelve feet in diameter, and one to two feet high, that it is difficult
to pass without being attacked by the insects. The “mounds” studding a
large portion of the prairie country of Louisiana seem also to be due
to the work of ants, although not inhabited at present.</p>

<p>Larger burrowing animals also assist in the task of mixing uniformly
the surface soils, and aiding root-penetration, as well as, in many
cases, the conservation of moisture. Seton (loc. cit.) even claims that
the pocket gophers (Thomomys) in a great degree replace the activity of
the earthworms in the arid region, where they, together with the voles
(commonly known there as field mice), exist in great numbers. Of course
the work of these animals, as well as that of the prairie dogs, ground
squirrels, badgers, etc., is incompatible with cultivation. But the
effects of their burrows on the native vegetation, and the indications
they give of the nature of the subsoil, are eminently useful to the
land-seeker.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">Thus in the rolling sediment-lands of the
Great Bend of the Columbia, the observer is surprised to see the “giant
rye grass,” usually at home in the moist lowlands, growing preferably
on the crests of the ridges bordering the horizon. Examination shows
that this is due to the burrowing of badgers, whereby the roots of
the grass are enabled to reach moisture at all times, even in that
extremely arid region.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">THEIR RELATIONS TO VEGETATION.</p>

<p><i>Physical Effects of the Percolation of Surface Waters.</i>—The
muddy water formed by the beating of rains on the soil surface will,
in penetrating the soil, carry with it the diffused colloidal clay to
a certain depth into the subsoil. We should therefore expect that as
a rule every subsoil will be more clayey than its surface soil; and
this is found to be almost universally the case in the humid region.
Subsoils are therefore almost always less precious and more retentive
of moisture, as well as of plant-food substances in solution, than
their surface soils, unless these are very rich in humus; and as the
finest particles are usually those richest in available plant-food,
it follows that subsoils will as a rule be found to contain larger
supplies of the latter than the surface soil. Common experience as well
as comparative analysis confirm both of these inferences so thoroughly,
that it becomes unnecessary to adduce examples in this place.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the reverse, upward movement of moisture caused
by surface evaporation tends constantly to bring any soluble salts
contained in the soil mass nearer to the surface, thus increasing the
stock of easily available plant-food in the surface soil. In extreme
cases, especially in the arid region, this accumulation of salts may
become excessive, and seriously injurious to plant growth. (See “Alkali
Soils”, chapters 21, 22.)</p>

<p><i>Chemical effects of Water-Percolation.</i>—The accumulation
of plant-food in the subsoil is not, however, due only to the
mechanically-carried particles, but also to the ingredients carried in
solution from the surface soil and redeposited in the more retentive
subsoils. Especially is this true of <i>lime carbonate</i>, which is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
dissolved by the carbonic acid formed chiefly within the humic surface
soil, and is often carried off in amounts sufficient to obstruct drain
tiles by its deposition in contact with air (<a href="#Page_29">see chapt. 3</a>).
In the case of moderate rains, however, it is carried no farther than the subsoil,
and is there redeposited, in consequence of the penetration of air,
following the water, and causing the carbonic gas to diffuse upward;
thus leaving the lime carbonate behind. In the majority of cases this
results simply in a gradual enriching of the subsoil in this substance;
while the surface soil may become so depleted as to require its
artificial replacement by liming or marling. The same general process
occurs to a less extent, in the case of magnesia.</p>

<p><i>Calcareous Subsoils.</i>—The fact that subsoils are more calcareous
than the corresponding surface soils is often of great practical
importance, in enabling the farmer to enrich his depleted surface soil
in lime by subsoil plowing. The accumulation of lime carbonate in
the subsoil also tends in a measure to offset the extreme heaviness
sometimes resulting from the accumulation of clay.</p>

<p><i>Calcareous Subsoils and Hardpans.</i>—When soils are very rich in
lime, and rains occur in limited showers rather than continuously, the
lime carbonate dissolved from the surface soil may accumulate in the
subsoil so as to either form calcareous “hardpan” by the cementing of
the subsoil mass; or it may accumulate and partly crystallize around
certain centers and thus form white concretions, known to farmers as
“white gravel.” The latter is the form usually assumed in the regions
of summer rains; while in the arid regions the deficient rainfall
causes this substance to accumulate, and calcareous hardpan to form, at
definite depths depending upon the maximum penetration of the annual
rainfall; sometimes in crystalline masses of veritable limestone
(“kankar” of India), or sometimes merely as crystalline incrustations
loosely cementing the subsoil.</p>

<p><i>“Rawness” of Subsoils in Humid Climates.</i>—From the greater
compactness of the subsoil which is almost universal in the humid
regions, the absence of humus and of the resulting formation of
carbonic and humic acids, it follows that its minerals are less subject
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
to the weathering process than are those of the surface soil. In the
farmer’s parlance, the subsoil is “raw” as compared with the surface
soil; it is not so suitable for plant-nutrition, and therefore must not
be brought to the surface to form the seed-bed, or be incorporated with
the surface soil to any considerable extent <i>at any one time</i>, if
crop-nutrition is to be normal. It is only in the course of time, by
exposure to atmospheric action as well as to that of the humus, and of
plant roots, that it becomes properly adapted to perform the functions
of the surface soil.</p>

<p><i>Soils and Subsoils in the Arid Region.</i>—But however pronounced
and important are these distinctions and differences in the humid
region, they are found to be profoundly modified in the arid; where, as
before stated, the formation of colloidal clay is very much diminished,
so that most soils formed under arid conditions are of a sandy or
pulverulent type. There is then little or no clay to be washed down
into the subsoil, hence there is no compacting of the latter; the air
consequently circulates freely down to the depth of many feet.</p>

<p>Thus one of the most important distinctions between soil and subsoil
is to a great extent practically non-existent in the arid region, at
least within the depths to which tillage can be made to reach; so that
the limitations attached to subsoil-plowing in the countries of summer
rains do not apply to the characteristic soils of the arid regions.</p>

<p>Even the distinction in regard to humus is here largely obliterated
by the circumstance, already alluded to, that most of that substance
must, in the arid regions, be derived from the decay of roots, which
moreover reach to much greater depth in these soils. Hence even in the
uplands of the arid region it is common to find no change of tint from
the surface down to three feet, and even more. This, like the free
circulation of the air in consequence of porosity, tends to render the
distinction of soil and subsoil practically useless; since it disposes
of the objection to “subsoiling” based upon the inert condition of the
subsoil, which in humid climates so effectually interferes with the
welfare of crops unless subsoiling is restricted to a fraction of an
inch at a time.</p>

<p>These fundamental differences in the soils of the two regions are
illustrated schematically in the subjoined diagram, which shows on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
left the contrast between clay or clay loam soils, in which the depth
of the surface soil-sample to be taken is prescribed as nine inches by
the rules of the Association of Am. Official Chemists (in the writer’s
experience it is more nearly six inches as a rule). Alongside of the
Eastern soil thus characterized is placed a typical “adobe” soil from
the grounds of the California Experiment station, of which a sample
showing uniform blackness to three feet depth was exhibited at the
World’s Fair at Chicago in 1893. At the right is a profile of the noted
hop soil on the bench lands of the Russian river, Cal., in which the
humus-content was determined down to twelve feet, the humus-percentage
being .44% at that depth against 1.21% in the surface foot (<a href="#Page_139">see chapt.
8, p. 139</a>). In this and similar soils the roots of hops reach down to
as much as fourteen feet without much lateral expansion; as shown in
plate No. 31 of this chapter. Similar conditions prevail in the sandy
uplands, as, <i>e. g.</i>, in the wheat lands of Stanislaus county,
Cal., mentioned above.</p>

<p>Taking the clay soils as a fair type for comparison, it would seem that
the farmer in the arid region owns from three to four farms, one above
another, as compared with the same acreage in the Eastern states.</p>

<p class="spb2"><i>Subsoils and Deep-plowing in the Arid Region.</i>—Up to the
present time this advantage is but little appreciated and acted upon by the
farmers of the arid region. They still instinctively cling to the
practice taught them by their fathers, and which is still promulgated
as the only correct practice, in most books on agriculture. There are
of course in the arid as well as in the humid region, cases in which
deep plowing is inadvisable; viz, that of marsh or swamp lands, as well
as sometimes in very sandy, porous soils, the cultural value of which
often depends essentially upon the presence of a somewhat consolidated,
and more retentive subsoil, which should not be broken up. But in most
soils not of extreme physical character, it is in the arid region not
only permissible, but eminently advisable to plow, for preparation, as
deeply as circumstances permit, in order to facilitate the penetration
of the roots beyond the reach of harm from the summer’s drought; while
for the same reason, subsequent cultivation should be to a moderate
depth only, for the better conservation of moisture, and the formation
of a protective surface mulch (<a href="#Page_234">see chapter 13</a>).

       illustrating differences in Soils of Humid and Arid Region.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
It must not be forgotten that there are in the lowlands of the arid
region (river swamps or tules, sea-coast marshes, etc.,) soils in which
surface soil and subsoil are differentiated as fully as in the humid
countries; at least so long as they have not been fully drained for a
considerable length of time. In swamp areas that have been elevated
above the reach of overflow or shallow bottom-water by geological
agencies, even the heavy swamp clays are fully aerated down to great
depths, and roots penetrate accordingly.</p>

<p><i>Examples of Plant-growth on Arid Subsoils.</i>—The fact that in the
arid region the surface-soil conditions reach to so much greater depths
than in the East and in Europe, is so important for farming practice
in that region that experimental evidence of the same should not be
withheld. Of such, some cases well established as typical of California
experience are therefore cited.</p>

<div class="blockquot fs_90">
<p>It is well known that in the Sierra Nevada of California the
placer mines of the Foothills, worked in the early times, have long
disappeared from sight, having been quickly covered by a growth of
the bull pine (<i>P. ponderosa</i>). Much of this timber growth has
for a number of years past been of sufficient size to be used for
timbering in mines, and a second young forest is springing up on what
was originally the red earth of the placer mines, which appears to the
eye as hopelessly barren as the sands of the desert. In this same red
sandy earth not unfrequently cellars and house foundations are dug, and
the material removed, even to the depth of eight feet, is fearlessly
put on the garden and there serves as a new soil, on which vegetables
and small fruits grow, the first year, as well as ever. In preparing
such land for irrigation by leveling or terracing no heed is taken of
the surface soil as against the subsoil, even where the latter must be
removed to the depth of several feet, so long as a sufficient depth of
soil material remains above the bedrock.</p>

<p>The same is generally true of the benchlands; the irrigator
levels, slopes or terraces his land for irrigation with no thought of
discrimination between soil and subsoil, and the cultural result as a
rule justifies his apparent carelessness. It is only where from special
causes a consolidated or hardpan subsoil is brought to the surface,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
that the land when leveled shows “spotted” crops. Such is the case in
some of the “hog-wallow” areas of the San Joaquin valley of California,
and in some cases where by long cultivation and plowing to the same
depth, a compact soil-layer or plowsole has been formed, and the land
is then leveled for the introduction of irrigation. In these cases a
section of the soil mass will usually show a marked difference in color
and texture. But, as a rule, in taking soil samples, no noticeable
difference can be perceived between the first and the second, and
oftentimes as far down as the third and fourth foot. The extraordinary
root-penetration of trees, shrubs and taprooted herbs, whose fibrous
feeding-roots are found deep in the subsoil and are sometimes wholly
absent from the surface soil, fully corroborate the conclusion reached
by the eye. The roots of grape vines have been found by the writer at
the depth of twenty-two feet below the surface, in a gravelly clay loam
varying but little the entire distance. In a similarly uniform and
pervious material, the loess of Nebraska, Aughey<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
reports the roots of the native Shepherdia to have been found at the
depth of fifty feet.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Resistance to Drought.</i>—These peculiarities of the soils of
the arid region explain without any resort to violent hypotheses, the
fact that many culture plants which in the regions of summer rains are
found to be dependent upon frequent and abundant rainfall, will in
California, and in the country west of the Rocky Mountains generally,
thrive and complete their growth and fruiting during periods of four
to six months of practically absolute cessation of rainfall; when east
of the Mississippi a similar cessation for as many <i>weeks</i> will
ruin the crops, if not kill the plants. In continental Europe, in 1892,
a six weeks’ drought caused almost all the fruit crops to drop from
the trees, and many trees failed to revive the next season; while at
the very same time, the same deciduous fruits gave a bountiful crop
in California, during the prevalence of the usual five or six months’
drought. This was without irrigation, or any aid beyond careful and
thorough surface tillage following the cessation of rains in April
or May, so as to leave the soil to the depth of five or six inches
in a condition of looseness perfectly adapted to the prevention of
evaporation from the moist subsoil, and of the conduction of the
excessive heat of the summer sun. This surface mulch will contain
practically no feeding-roots, the paralysis or death of which by heat
and drought would influence sensibly the welfare of the growing plant.

          (Wisconsin) Fruit Tree.<br> (Photograph by Prof F. H. King.)</p>
</div>

<p><i>Root-system in the Humid Region.</i>—It is quite otherwise where a
dense subsoil not only obstructs mechanically the deep penetration of
any but the strongest roots, but at the same time is itself too inert
to provide sufficiently abundant nourishment apart from the surface
soil, which is there the portion containing, alongside of humus, the
bulk of the available plant-food, and in which alone the processes of
absorption and nutrition find the proper conditions; such as access
of air and the ready and minute penetration of even the most delicate
rootlets and root-hairs. The largest and most active portion of the
root-system being thus accumulated in the surface soil, it follows
that unless the latter is constantly kept in a fair condition of
moistness, the plant must suffer material injury very quickly; hence
the often fatal effects of even a few weeks’ drought. The same occurs
in the arid region when often-repeated shallow plowing has resulted in
the formation of a “plowsole” which prevents the deep penetration of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
roots; when a hot “norther” will often in a short time not only dry the
plowed soil, but will heat it to such extent as to actually bake the
roots it harbors. Under the same weather-conditions an adjoining field,
properly plowed, may almost wholly escape injury.</p>

<p><i>Comparison of root development in the arid and humid
regions.</i>—Figures 28, 29 given here show the differences as
actually seen in the case of fruit trees as grown in Wisconsin
and California, respectively, both in the absence of artificial
water-supply.</p>

<p><i>Adaptation of humid species to arid conditions.</i>—Figures, in No.
30, show the root systems respectively of the riverside grape (<i>Vitis
riparia</i>) as grown in the Mississippi Valley states, and the natural
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
development as found in the Rock grape of Missouri and also in the wild
grape vine of California. It will be noted at once that the latter
directs its cord-like roots almost vertically from the first, until
it reaches a depth varying from 12 to 18 inches, where it begins to
branch more freely, but still with a strong downward tendency in all.
The roots of the riverside grape, on the contrary, tend to spread
almost horizontally, branching freely at the depth of a few inches and
manifestly deriving its supply both of plant-food and moisture mainly
from the surface soil. It is curious to observe the behavior of this
vine when cuttings are planted in California vineyards as a resistant
grafting-stock. Its first roots are sent out horizontally, very much as
is its habit in the East, so long as the soil moisture is maintained
near the surface. But as the season advances, the more superficial
rootlets are first thrown out of action by the advancing dryness and
heat of the surface soil, and many finally die the first year.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img id="FIG_30" src="images/image170.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="414" >
    <p class="f90"><span class="smcap">Fig. 30.</span>—Root Growth of Resistant Grape Vines.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
Not unfrequently the entire root system developed by the uppermost bud
perishes; but usually its main roots soon begin to recede from the
threatening drought and heat of the surface, curving, or branching
downward in the direction of the moisture supply, and without detriment
to their nutrition because of the practical identity of the surface
soil and subsoil. As the portions of the roots near the surface thicken
and mature, their corky rind soon prevents their being injured by the
arid conditions to which they are subjected; while the root-ends,
finding congenial conditions of nutriment and aeration in the moist
depths, develop without difficulty as they would in their humid home.
Practically the same process of adaptation takes place in every one of
the trees, shrubs, or perennials belonging to the humid climates, until
their root system has assumed nearly the habit of the corresponding
native vegetation.</p>

<p>The photograph of the roots of a hop plant, grown on bench lands of the
Sacramento river, shows the roots extending to 8 feet depth, but where
broken off the main root is still nearly two millimeters in thickness,
proving that it penetrated at least two feet beyond the depth shown in
<a href="#FIG_31">figure 31.</a></p>

<p>In the case of native annuals, either the duration of their vegetation
is extremely short, ending with or shortly after the cessation of
rains; or else their tap roots descend so low, and the nutritive
rootlets are developed at such depth, as to be beyond reach of the
summer’s heat and drought. For while it is true that rootlets immersed
in air-dry soil may absorb plant-food, this absorption is very slow
and can only be auxiliary to the main root system which, instead of
terminating in the surface soil as in the humid region, will be found
to begin to branch off at depths of 15 and 18 inches, and may then in
sandy lands descend to from 4 to 7 feet even in the case of annual
fibrous-rooted plants like wheat and barley.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
In the case of maize the roots of a late-planted crop may sometimes be
found descending along the walls of the sun-cracks in heavy clay land
poorly cultivated; and it frequently matures a crop without the aid of
a single shower after planting. See figures 33, 34.

The annexed plate (No. 32) shows the main roots of two native perennial
weeds of California, the goosefoot (<i>Chenopodium californicum</i>)
and the figwort (<i>Scrophularia californica</i>), common on the
lower slopes of the coast ranges. The soil was a heavy clay loam or
“black adobe” resulting from the weathering of the clay shale bedrock,
fragments of which are so abundantly intermixed with the substrata that
excavation of the roots became very difficult. Yet the main root of the
goosefoot went down below the depth of eleven feet.</p>

<p>The main root of the figwort, also, was followed below the depth of ten
feet without reaching the extreme end. This proves clearly that the
great penetration of the goosefoot was not, as might be supposed, due
to its bulbous root. Yet such thickening of the root just below the
crown is a rather common feature in arid-region plants, and can here be
noted even in the figwort, within whose botanical relationship bulbous
roots are almost unknown.</p>

<p>Any one accustomed to the cornfields of the Middle West, where in the
after-cultivation of maize it is necessary to restrict very carefully
the depth of tillage to avoid bringing up a mat of white, fibrous
roots, will be at once impressed with the remarkable adaptability of
maize to different climatic conditions, as exhibited in such cases and
shown in figures 33, 34. In southern California, in the deep mesa or
bench soils, corn stalks so tall that a man standing on horseback can
barely reach the tassel, and with two or three large ears, are quite
commonly grown under similar rainfall-conditions.</p>

<p><i>Importance of proper Substrata in the Arid Region.</i>—The
paramount need of deep penetration of roots in the arid region renders
the substrata below the range of what is usually understood by subsoil
in the humid climates, of exceptional importance. A good farmer
anywhere will examine the subsoil to the depth of two feet before
investing in land; but more than this is necessary in the arid region,
where the surface soil is often almost thrown out of action during the
greater part of the growing season, while the needful moisture and
nourishment must be wholly drawn from the subsoil and substrata; an
examination of which should therefore precede every purchase of land,
or planting of crops.

<p class="blockquot fs_90">Such examinations are most quickly made by
means of a probe consisting of a pointed, square steel rod five or
six feet long, provided at one end with a loop for the insertion of a
cross-handle like that of a carpenter’s auger. The handle being grasped
with both hands, the probe is forced into the soil with a slight
reciprocating motion, by the weight of the operator; who soon learns
how to interpret the varying kinds of resistance, and on withdrawing
the probe carefully will generally be able to determine if bottom water
has been reached. Should this easy method of examination not convey
all the needful information, the post-hole auger may be resorted to;
and it is desirable that extra (three-foot) rods or gaspipe joints
be provided for the purpose of lengthening the probe or auger, when
necessary, to nine or twelve feet. It will rarely be necessary to go to
the trouble of digging a pit for such examinations; but even this is to
be recommended rather than “buying a cat in a bag” in the guise of an
unexplored subsoil.</p>

<p><i>Faulty Substrata.</i>—A number of examples of “faulty lands,”
<i>i. e.</i>, such as are underlaid by faulty substrata, are given in
the annexed diagram <a href="#FIG_35">Fig. 35</a>; the examples being taken from
California localities because of their having been most thoroughly investigated.
Similar cases, as well as others not here illustrated, of course occur
more or less all over the world.</p>

<p>No. 1 shows a case which, though at first sight an aggravated one of a
rocky substratum, is in reality that of some of the best fruit lands
in the State. The limited surface-soil is very rich, and is directly
derived (as a “sedentary” soil) from the underlying bedrock slate. But
this it will be noted stands <i>on edge</i>, and the roots of trees
and vines wedge their way along the cleavage planes of the slate to
considerable depth, deriving from them both nourishment and moisture.
Under similar conditions the California laurel, usually found on the
banks of streams, grows on the summits of rocky ridges in the Coast Ranges.</p>

<p>The case of No. 2 is quite otherwise. Here the shale lies horizontally,
and though much softer than the slate of the first column, obstinately
resists the penetration of roots; so that the land, though fairly
provided with plant-food, is almost wholly useless for cultivation. It
is naturally covered with low, stunted shrubs or chaparral; only here
and there, where a cleft has been caused by earthquakes or subsidence,
a large pine tree indicates that nourishment and moisture exists within
the refractory clay stratum, and suggests blasting as a means of
rendering the land fit for trees at least.

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
No. 3 is a case similar to that of No. 2, only there is here a dense
unstratified mass of red clay, of good native fertility. It is here
that the expedient of blasting the tree holes with dynamite was first
successfully employed, in central California. For lack of this,
extensive tracts of similar land in southern California, planted to
orchards, have completely failed of useful results after three years of
culture.</p>

<p>No. 4 shows a typical case of calcareous hardpan obstructing the
penetration of roots, even though usually interrupted at intervals,
because of the formation occurring mostly in swales, along which
the sheets lie more or less continuously. Here also, blasting will
generally permit the successful growth of trees and vines, whose roots
frequently will, in time, wholly disintegrate the hardpan and thus
render the land fit for field cultures. The depth at which such hardpan
is formed usually depends upon the depth to which the annual rainfall
penetrates. (See below, page 183).</p>

<p>Nos. 4, 5, and 6 all illustrate cases of intrinsically fertile, very
deep soils, shallowed by obstructions which in the case of No. 4 are
hardpan sheets, while in No. 5 the intervention of bottom water limits
root penetration, hence restricts the use of the land to relatively
shallow-rooted crops, and the use of only a few feet of the profusely
fertile soil. Such is the case where bottom water has been allowed to
rise too high, through the use of leaky irrigation ditches.</p>

<p>No. 6 illustrates a case not uncommon in sedimentary lands, where
bottom water is quite within reach of most plants, but is prevented
from being utilized by the intervention of layers of coarse sand or
gravel, through which the water will not rise; and the roots, while
they would be able to penetrate, are not near enough to feel the
presence of water underneath and therefore spread on the surface of
the gravel, suffering from drought within easy reach of abundance of
water. The “going-back” of large portions of orange orchards in the
San Bernardino Valley of California has been thus brought about; and
unfortunately this state of things is almost beyond the possibility of remedy.

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
<i>Injury from Impervious Substrata.</i>—The injurious effects of a
difficultly penetrable subsoil have already been discussed and are
self-evident. When the substratum is a dense clay, the rise of moisture
from below being very slow, it can easily happen that the roots cannot
penetrate deep enough in time for the coming of the dry season, and
that thus the crop will suffer. The case will be still worse when
hardpan cemented by lime or silex limits root-penetration, as well as
proper drainage. In such cases the culture of field crops often becomes
impracticable, even with irrigation, as its frequent repetition,
besides being costly, can rarely be commanded. In the case of trees,
the limitation of root-penetration results in the spreading-out of the
roots on the surface of the impenetrable layer; as shown in <a href="#FIG_36">figure 36</a>,
which exhibits a root-development that would be quite normal in the
regions of summer rains, but is wholly abnormal in the arid region, and
results in the unprofitableness or death of the trees. It has often
been attempted in such cases to plant trees in large holes dug deep
into the subsoil and refilled with surface earth and manure. All such
attempts result in failure, if only because the excavation inevitably
fills with water, which will soak away but very slowly into the dense
substrata, and will thus injure or drown out the roots. Besides, the
latter will remain bunched in the loose earth, and will thus be unable
to draw either moisture or nourishment from the surrounding land. It
is absolutely necessary to remedy this by loosening the substrata, if
success is to be attained.</p>

<p><i>Shattering of Dense Substrata by Dynamite.</i>—The permanent
loosening of dense substrata is best accomplished by moderate charges
(½ to ¾ pounds) of “No. 2” dynamite at a sufficient depth (3 to 5
feet). The shattering effect of the explosive will be sensible to the
depth of eight feet or more, and will fissure the clay or hardpan to
a corresponding extent sidewise. If properly proportioned the charge
will hardly disturb the surface; but if this be desired, from 1½ to 2½
pounds of black powder placed above the dynamite will throw out
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
sufficient earth to plant the tree without farther digging. Where labor
is high-priced this proves the cheapest as well as the best way to
prepare such ground for tree planting; and it has often been found that
in the course of time, the loosening begun by the powder has extended
through the mass of the land so as to permit the roots to utilize it
fully, and even to permit, in after years, of the planting of field
crops where formerly they would not succeed.</p>

<p><i>Leachy Substrata.</i>—While we may thus overcome the disadvantages
of a dense subsoil or hardpan, there is another difficulty not
uncommonly met with in alluvial lands, which cannot be so readily
remedied. It is the occurrence, at from two to six feet depth, of
coarse sand or gravel, through which capillary moisture will not
ascend, but through which irrigation water will waste rapidly, leaving
the overlying soil dry. Then unless very frequent irrigation can be
given, the crop will suffer from drought, unless indeed the gravel
itself is filled with bottom water upon which the root-ends can draw.</p>

<p>This case is a common one in the larger valleys of the arid region, and
in time of unusual drought the sloughs originally existing, but since
filled up, will be clearly outlined by the dying crops, while outside
of the old channels there may be no suffering.</p>

<p><i>“Going-back” of Orchards.</i> On such land as this, and on such
as has a shallow soil underlaid by an impervious subsoil, trees will
often grow finely for three to five years; then suddenly languish,
or turn yellow and die, as the demand of their larger growth exceeds
what moisture or plant-food the shallow soil and subsoil can supply.
Enormous losses have arisen from this cause in many portions of the
arid region, but more especially in California, owing to the implicit
confidence reposed even by old settlers, and still more by newcomers,
in the excellence of the lands, as illustrated by farms perhaps a short
distance away, but differently situated with respect to the country
drainage and the geological formations. All such disappointments could
have been avoided by an intelligent observation of the substrata,
either by probing or digging. Important as is such preliminary
examination in the region of summer rains, it is a <i>vitally</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
needful precaution in the arid region, where the margin between
adequate and inadequate depth of soil and moisture-supply is much
smaller.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">When farmers note such distress in the
orchard, the first idea usually is that fertilization is needed. This
in the almost universally very rich lands of the arid region is rarely
the case until after many years of exhaustive cultivation, and is
scarcely ever of more than passing benefit in such cases. The first
suggestion should always be an <i>examination of the substrata</i>, and
especially of the deeper roots; in the diseased or thirsty condition of
which the cause of the “die-back” or yellowing will commonly be found.
Of course no amount of fertilization can permanently remedy such a
state of things, arising from impervious substrata, coarse gravel, or
shallow bottom water.</p>

<p><i>Hardpan.</i>—By “hardpan” is understood a dense and more or less
hardened layer in the subsoil, which obstructs the penetration of both
roots and water, thus materially limiting the range of the former both
for plant-food and moisture, and giving rise to the disadvantages
following such limitation, as described in the case of dense subsoils.
The hardpans proper differ from the latter, however, in being usually
of limited thickness only; the direct consequence of their mode of
formation, which is not direct deposition by water or other agencies,
but the infiltration of cementing solutions into a pre-existing
material originally quite similar to that of the surface soil. Such
solutions usually come from above, more rarely from below, and are of
very various composition. The solutions of lime carbonate in carbonated
water have already been referred to in this connection; as has also the
fact that corresponding solutions of silica, associated more or less
with other products of rock decomposition (see chapters 2 and 4) are
constantly circulating in soils. The surface soil being the portion
where rock-weathering and other soil-forming processes are most active,
these solutions are chiefly formed there; and according as their
descent into the substrata is unchecked, or is liable to be arrested
at some particular level, whether by pre-existing close-grained layers
or by the cessation of rains, the subsequent penetration of air, and
evaporation of the water alone by shallow-rooted plants, may cause the
accumulation of the dissolved matter at a certain level, year after
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
year. Finally there is formed a subsoil-mass more or less firmly
cemented by the dissolved matters, sometimes to the extent of stony
hardness (lime carbonate in the arid regions, kankar of India), more
usually soft enough to be penetrated by the pick or grubbing hoe, and
sometimes by the stronger roots of certain plants; but resisting both
the penetration and the assimilation of plant food by the more delicate
feeding roots.</p>

<p><i>Nature of the Cements.</i>—The nature of the cements that serve
to consolidate the hardpan mass is substantially the same as those
already mentioned in the discussion of sandstones (<a href="#Page_55">chapt. 4, p. 55</a>);
with the addition of those formed, usually in connection with siliceous
solutions, by the acids of the humus group. The latter class of
hardpans is especially conspicuous in the case of swampy ground and
damp forests, where “moorbedpan” and reddish “ortstein” (the latter
particularly developed in the forests of northern Europe, where it has
been studied in detail by Müller and Tuxen<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>,
are characteristic.) The latter gives for a characteristic sample of
the reddish hardpan underlying a beech forest in Denmark a content of
from 2.20 to 4.40% of ulmic compounds, and shows that the color is
due to these and not, as had been supposed, to ferric oxid, which is
present only in minute quantities.</p>

<p><i>Bog ore, Moorbedpan, Ortstein.</i>—It is otherwise with moorbedpan,
which often consists of a mass of bog iron ore permeated more or less
with humous substances, which impart to it the dark brown tint so
often seen also in the “black gravel” spots of badly-drained land. On
the whole, however, ferric cements are much less frequently found in
hardpans than in sandstones formed above ground.</p>

<p><i>Clay substance</i> washed from the surface into the subsoil by rains
(<a href="#Page_161">chapter 10, p. 161</a>) always helps materially to render the
hardpan impervious when afterwards cemented, a much smaller proportion of the
cementing material sufficing in that case to form a solid layer. In
such cases however the cement is rarely of a calcareous nature, since
lime prevents the diffusion and washing-down of the clay. It is mostly
siliceous or zeolitic; if the former, acid will have little or no
effect upon the solidity of the hardpan; while if zeolitic, acid will
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
pretty promptly disintegrate it. The presence of humus acids in the
cements, if not apparent to the eye, is readily demonstrated by
immersing the hardpan fragment in ammonia water or a weak solution of
caustic soda; when if humus acids are the main cementing substance the
fragment will fall to crumbs, or be softened to an extent corresponding
to the amount of the humus present. Calcareous hardpan is, of course,
readily recognized by its quick disintegration by dilute acid, with
evolution of carbonic gas.</p>

<p>In “alkali” soils containing sodic carbonate (“black alkali”) there
is commonly found at the depth of two or three feet an exceedingly
refractory hardpan resulting from the accumulation of puddled clay
(<a href="#Page_62">see above chapt. 4, p. 62</a>) in the subsoil, or
sometimes even on the surface of depressed spots. This hardpan, easily
destroyed by the use of gypsum and water, is described more in detail
in <a href="#Page_422">chapter 22</a>, on alkali soils; it blues red
litmus paper instantly.</p>

<p><i>The Causes of Hardpan.</i>—The recognition of the <i>cause</i>
of hardpan is of considerable importance to the farmer, because of
the influence of the nature of the cement and the causes of its
formation upon the possibility and methods of its destruction, for the
improvement of the land.</p>

<p>It may be said in general that inasmuch as the cause of the formation
of hardpan is a stoppage of the water in its downward penetration, the
re-establishment of that penetration will tend to prevent additional
induration; moreover, experience proves that whenever this is
accomplished even locally, as around a fruit tree in an orchard, the
hardpan gradually softens and disappears before the frequent changes in
moisture-conditions and the attack of roots. The use of dynamite for
this purpose in California has already been referred to; it seems to
be the only resort when the hardpan lies at a considerable depth. When
it is within reach of the plow, it may be turned up on the surface by
the aid of a subsoiler and will then gradually disintegrate under the
influence of air, rain and sun. But when the hardpan is of the nature
of moorbedpan, containing much humic acid and perhaps underlaid by bog
iron ore, the use of lime on the land is indicated, and will in the
course of time destroy the hardpan layer. This is the more desirable as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
in such cases the surface soil is usually completely leached of its
lime content, and is consequently extremely unthrifty.</p>

<p>Woodlands of northern countries bearing beech and oak are especially
apt to be benefited by the action of lime on the “raw,” acid humous
soil and underlying hardpan, which is commonly underlaid by a
leaden-blue sandy subsoil (“Bleisand” of the Germans, “Podzol” of
the Russians) colored brown by earth humates and mostly too moist in
its natural condition to permit of adequate aeration. These soils
are usually of but moderate fertility, and are best suited to forest
growth unless somewhat expensive methods of improvement can be put into
practice.</p>

<p>“<i>Plowsole.</i>”—An artificial hardpan is very commonly formed
under the practice of plowing to the same depth for many consecutive
years. The consolidated layer thus created by the action of the plow
(hence known as plowsole) acts precisely like a natural hardpan,
and is sometimes the cause of the formation of a cemented subsoil
crust simulating the natural product. This is most apt to occur in
clayey lands, and greatly increases the difficulty of working them,
while detracting materially from the higher productiveness commonly
attributed to them as compared with sandy lands. Of course it is
perfectly easy to prevent this trouble by plowing to different depths
in consecutive years, and running a subsoil plow from time to time. In
this case, also, lime will generally be very useful and be found to aid
materially in the disintegration of the “plowsole.”</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to insist farther upon the need of the
examination of land to be occupied, for the existence of hardpan or
other faulty subsoil, which may totally defeat for the time being the
farmer’s efforts, or make him lose his investment in plantations after
a few years. Probing by means of the steel rod described above (<a href="#Page_177">p. 177</a>)
or boring with a post-hole auger; or finally, if necessary, digging
a pit to the proper depth (from four to six feet in the arid region),
should precede every purchase of new or unexplored agricultural land.</p>

<p><i>Marly Substrata.</i>—Among the causes of failure occasionally found
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
in the case of the “going-back” of orchards, is the occurrence of
strongly calcareous or marly substrata, at depths which in the humid
region would not be reached by the roots, but in the course of a few
years are inevitably penetrated by the roots of trees in the arid
region. Then there appears a stunting of the growth, and sometimes a
yellowing of leaves, or chlorosis, due to the influence of excessive
calcareousness at the depth of four or five feet. For this of course
there is no remedy except the planting of crops which, like the
mulberry, Texas grapes, Chickasaw plum and others, are at home on such
lands; which in the Eastern states are naturally occupied by the crab
apple, honey locust and wild plums.</p>

<p>When it is remembered that from 65 to over 90% of the fresh substance
of plants consists of water, the importance of an adequate and regular
supply of the same to growing plants is readily understood. But it
seems desirable, before discussing the relations of water to the soil
and to plant life, to consider first the physical peculiarities which
distinguish it from nearly all other substances known. That it is
colorless, tasteless, inodorous, and also chemically neutral, alone
constitutes a group of properties scarcely found in any other fluid.
But its special adaptation to its functions in relation to vegetable
and animal life are much more fundamental, as is shown in the table of

<p>Summarizing the meaning of the data given in the above table with
respect to organic life, we see, first, that water rises higher both in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
the soil and in the tissues of the plant than any other liquid.
Second, that as its density decreases in cooling after a certain
point is reached, it freezes at the <i>surface</i> instead of at the
<i>bottom</i>, as other liquids do; and as solid water (ice) is lighter
than fluid water, ice stays at the surface and is readily melted when
spring comes. Third, since its temperature changes more slowly than
that of any other liquid, it serves to prevent injuriously rapid
changes of temperature in plants and animals as well as in soils. Its
high “heat of fusion” also serves to prevent quick freezing of plant
and animal tissues, so that the brief prevalence of a low temperature
may be more readily borne. Finally, the large amount of heat absorbed
in evaporation of water serves to keep both plants and animals cool
under excessive external temperatures which would otherwise quickly
destroy life.</p>

<p><i>Capillarity or Surface Tension.</i>—In this table it will be noted,
first, that water rises higher in fine (“capillary”) or hair tubes than
the other fluids mentioned, which fairly represent all others. No other
fluid approaches water in the height to which it will rise<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
in either soils or plant tissues. Were its capillary factor no higher than,
<i>e. g.</i>, that of oil or alcohol, trees could not grow as tall as we find
them, and the water supply from the substrata, and all the movements of
water in the soil, and hence plant growth, would be similarly retarded.
It is easy to verify these differences by immersing a cylinder of clay
soil (or a cotton wick) in water on the one hand, and in oil or alcohol
on the other. Notwithstanding the greater fluidity of alcohol as
compared with water, the latter will be found to fill the porous mass
much more quickly.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">The smaller the diameter of the tube, the
higher will the water rise in it, and the greater will be the curvature
of its upper surface, to which the rise is sensibly proportional. But
in the case of liquids which do not “wet” the walls of the tube (as in
that of mercury and glass), the curve (meniscus) is convex, instead of
concave, and the liquid is depressed instead of rising.</p>

<p>It is in its <i>relations to heat</i>, however, that water is specially
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
distinguished from other substances; and these differences are most
vital not only to living organisms, but to the entire economy of Nature.</p>

<p><i>Density.</i>—As regards the density or specific gravity of water
(which is by common consent assumed as the unit of comparison), it
will be seen from the “Density” table that whereas all other bodies
contract and become more dense as they grow colder, water has its point
of (fluid) “maximum density” at 4°C. (49°.2 Fahr.), and <i>expands</i>
as it grows colder, until at 0°C. (32° Fahr.) it solidifies into ice.
In so doing it departs still farther from the rule obtaining with all
other bodies (excepting certain mixtures, such as type metal) and
again expands so as to decrease the density from .99988 to .92800;
thus causing ice to float on water at the freezing point. Hence water,
unlike all other fluids, solidifies first on the surface; and but for
this, the thawing of the winter’s ice, which would be formed at the
bottom of rivers and lakes, would be deferred until late in summer. The
expansion of water in freezing is forcibly illustrated in the bursting
of water pipes and pitchers in winter; in the soil, the ice forming in
the interstices serves to loosen the compacted land and give it better
tilth for the ensuing season.</p>

<p><i>Specific Heat.</i>—Considering next, the column showing the
“specific heat” of water as compared with other substances, we see that
it exceeds all other known bodies in the amount of heat required to
change its temperature; hence again, <i>its</i> heat capacity is taken
as the unit to which all others are compared. The figures given in the
table show that even ice and steam require for equal weights only about
half as much heat (or burning of fuel) to change their temperature
(<i>e. g.</i>, 1 degree) as would liquid water. But earthy matters,
such as clay or soil and glass, require only one-fifth as much heat for
a similar change; charcoal only about one-fourth as much. But vegetable
matter as represented by wood on the one hand, and gold and lead on the
other, require only about one-thirtieth as much heat as an equal weight
of water; zinc about one-tenth as much, steel somewhat more.</p>

<p>It is thus plain that masses of water act powerfully, more than any
other substance, as moderators of changes of temperature by their mere
presence. The body of an animal or plant is protected against violent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
changes by the presence of from 60% to 90% of liquid water, the
temperature of which can only be raised or lowered slowly; and the
presence of the sea tempers the climates of coasts and islands as
compared with the heat or cold occurring in the interior of the
continents.</p>

<p><i>Ice.</i>—Again, it is shown in the table that the heat required to
<i>melt ice</i> is greater than in the case of any other substance,
especially the metals; which when once heated to the fusing point,
require only a very little more heat to become liquid. The fusion of
salts (including silicate rocks) requires more heat than does that of
the pure metals.</p>

<p><i>Vaporization.</i>—In the amount of heat required for its
<i>vaporization</i> water is also especially pre-eminent, and
potent in its influence upon organic life. The table shows that the
evaporation of water requires six hundred heat units<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
as compared with alcohol, requiring only two hundred; while spirits of turpentine,
the representative of a large proportion of vegetable fluids, needs but sixty-seven.</p>

<p>The practical result is that evaporation of water from the surface
of animals and the leaves of plants, is exceedingly effective in
preventing excessive rise of temperature, the heat of the sun and air
being spent in evaporating the perspiration of animals and plants
before an injurious rise of temperature, such as would cause sunstroke
in animals, and wilting or withering in plants, can occur. But since
evaporation is most rapid in dry air, it follows that the cooling
effect will be the greater in the arid regions than in the humid. In
the latter, therefore, sunstroke is much more frequent than in the
fervid regions of the arid west, even though the temperature in the
latter may be higher by twenty or twenty-five degrees Fahrenheit.
White men who would soon succumb if they attempted to work in the
sun in Mississippi or Louisiana when the thermometer stands at 95°F.
will experience no inconvenience under the same conditions in the dry
atmosphere of the Great Valley of California.</p>

<p><i>Solvent Power.</i>—To the exceptional properties of water discussed
above, should be added another hardly less important one, viz., that of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
being an almost universal solvent especially of mineral matters,
including even those which, like quartz, appear to be most insoluble
and refractory (<a href="#Page_29">see chapt. 3</a>). The water of the soil is thus
enabled to convey to the roots of plants, in solution, all kinds of plant food
contained in the soil. It should be noted that distilled (hence also
rain-) water is a more powerful solvent, <i>e. g.</i>, of glass, than
ordinary waters containing mineral matter, and even free acids.</p>

<p>Practically, plants take up <i>all</i> their water supply from the
soil in the liquid form; and hence the soil-conditions with respect
to this supply are of the most vital importance to plant growth. The
most abundant supply of mineral plant food may be wholly useless,
unless the physical conditions of adequate soil-moisture, access of
air, and warmth, are fulfilled at the same time. On the other hand,
comparatively few plants are adapted to healthy growth in soils
saturated with water, or in water itself; and but few among these are
of special interest from the agricultural standpoint.</p>

<p><i>Water-requirements of Growing Plants.</i>—The amount of water
contained in any plant at one time, however large, is but a small
proportion of what is necessary to carry it through its full
development. When we measure the amount of water actually evaporated
through the plant in the course of its normal growth, we find it to be
several hundred times the quantity of dry vegetable substance produced;
varying according to the extent and structure of the leaf-surface, the
number and size of the breathing pores (stomata) of the leaves, and
the climatic conditions (including specially the duration of active
vegetation, and temperature during the same), from 225 to as much as
912 times the weight of the mature, dry plant.</p>

<p>The following are extreme figures for water consumption of different
plants as reported by different observers, viz., Lawes and Gilbert in
England, Hellriegel in northern Germany, Wollny in Southern Germany
(Munich), and King in Wisconsin: Wheat, 225 to 359; barley, 262 to 774;
oats, 402 to 665; red clover, 249 to 453; peas, 235 to 447; mustard
and rape, 845 to 912 respectively; the latter figure being the maximum
thus far reported. The highest figures given are throughout very nearly
those of Wollny, working in the very rainy climate of Munich.</p>

<p><i>Evaporation from Plants in Different Climates.</i>—It might be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
expected that in countries where the air is usually moist, the
evaporation will, other things being equal, be less than where it is
commonly far below the point of saturation. But the “guardian cells”
(stomata) of the leaf pores possess the power of regulating, to a
certain extent, the evaporation from the leaf-surface in accordance
with temporarily prevailing conditions, so as to allow free evaporation
in moist air, but to prevent the wilting and drying-up of the leaf in
hot and dry air, save in extreme cases. Moreover, plants adapted to
arid conditions are usually provided with additional safeguards in the
form of thick, non-conducting layers of surface cells, or long channels
connecting the interior tissue with the breathing-pores on the surface.
Often hairy, scaly or viscous coverings serve the same end. On the
other hand, when the air is very moist, so as to check evaporation,
water is sometimes found secreted in minute droplets around the
breathing-pores of the leaves, since its ascent is a necessary
condition of nutrition and development.</p>

<p><i>Relation between Evaporation and Plant-growth.</i>—There is not in
all cases any direct relation between the amount of evaporation and
plant growth; but experience, as well as numerous rigorous experiments
have shown that <i>under ordinary conditions of culture, and within
limits varying for different soils and crops, production is almost
directly proportional to the water supply during the period of active
vegetation</i>.</p>

<p>On the basis of Hellriegel’s results, showing that wheat uses (in
Germany) about 435 tons, or nearly four acre-inches of water in the
production of one ton of dry matter, and assuming the ratio of grain
to straw to be 1:1.5, King calculates the following table of probable
production under different moisture conditions (Physics of Agriculture,
page 140):</p>

S. Fortier has made several series of tests to determine the actual
yield of grain crops under field conditions when supplied with
different amounts of water. Two of these were made at the Montana
experiment station in 1902 and 1903, (see reports of these years), in
large tanks placed in a field, level with the ground. The results of
the last year’s experiments are shown graphically in the <a href="#FIG_37">figure below</a>,
from which it will be seen that the yield increased quite regularly
with the amount of water supplied, up to the depth of 36 inches of water.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

    <p class="f90"><span class="smcap">Fig. 37.</span>—Experiments on Cereal
     production with<br> various amounts of water<br>(Fortier, Report Mont.
     Expt. Sta., 1903).</p>
</div>

<p>It should be noted that in this case (and as usual) not only the
quantity but the quality of the grain was greatly improved as the
water-supply increased, it becoming larger and more uniform in size.</p>

<p>Of similar experiments made in the San Joaquin Valley, California, in
1904, Fortier says:<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">“In experimenting with barley last winter
the natural rainfall, which amounted to 4½ inches during the period
of growth, produced at the rate of nine bushels per acre, while
the application of sixteen inches of water increased the yield to
twenty-two bushels per acre. In the same case; of wheat, the rainfall,
alone, produced straw, but no grain; four inches of additional
irrigation water produced a yield at the rate of ten bushels, and sixteen
inches of water increased the yield to thirty-eight bushels per acre.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
It is thus obvious that, other things being equal and with conditions
sufficiently favorable for the growth of crops, the rule as formulated
above is verified in practice.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">Whitney (Bulletin 22, Bureau of Soils,
U.S. Dept. Agr.), has carried this rule so far as to claim that in
all soils, the moisture supply is the <i>only</i> important factor,
and that so long as this is provided for, soil fertility continues
indefinitely without replacement of ingredients withdrawn. The latter
conclusion is so thoroughly disproved by experience as well as
experiment that it hardly requires discussion here.</p>

<p>Whether plants, especially cultivated ones, are capable of adapting
themselves to arid conditions so as to be capable of producing
satisfactory crops with less water than is actually consumed in the
humid region, has not been directly determined. Such is, however, the
impression produced by farming experience; and the fact that among
the common weeds of arid California are mustard and rape, cited by
Wollny<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
as requiring over three times as much water as does maize for the
production of one part of dry matter, lends color to the supposition
that in some manner these, and probably other plants, use more water in
humid than in dry climates (<a href="#Page_212">see this chapt. p. 212</a>).</p>

<p>It is therefore impossible to assign a definite figure for the amount
of water required by vegetation <i>at large</i>; and even for one and
the same plant, only approximations conditioned upon climatic factors
can be given. We can in many cases, however, assign for one plant, or
for certain groups of plants, the amounts of water producing the best
results (“optimum”) and the least amount (“minimum”) compatible with
a paying crop, that must be furnished during the growing season, to
produce certain results. For when instead of fruiting, it is desired
that the crop should produce the largest possible amount of vegetable
substance, as in the case of forage crops, a larger amount of water
will usually be serviceable.</p>

<p><i>Different conditions of Soil-Water.</i>—Water may be contained in
the soil in three different conditions, viz.:</p>

<p>1. From absorption of water vapor; Hygroscopic water.</p>

<p>2. Liquid water held suspended between the soil particles so as to
exert no hydrostatic pressure; capillary water, or water of imbibition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
3. Liquid water seeking its level; bottom, ground or hydrostatic water.</p>

<h4>HYGROSCOPIC WATER.</h4>

<p>Soils artificially dried so as to deprive them of all their moisture,
when exposed to moist air absorb water vapor with great energy at
first; both the rapidity of absorption and the amounts absorbed, when
full time is given, varying greatly with their nature. Sandy soils,
broadly speaking, absorb the smallest amounts; while clayey soils, and
those containing much humus, or finely divided ferric hydrate, take up
the largest proportion.</p>

<p>The figure expressing the amount of aqueous vapor absorbed at the
standard temperature of 15° Cent., is called the <i>coefficient
of moisture absorption</i>. For one and the same substance, this
coefficient rises as the grain becomes finer, the surface being
correspondingly increased (<a href="#Page_83">see chapt. 6</a>).</p>

<p>The table below indicates the effect of the three substances mentioned
in increasing moisture absorption as compared with a very sandy soil
from the pine woods of Mississippi, and a gray silt or “dust” soil
from Washington, very fine-grained but poor both in humus and ferric
hydrate. (For details of the physical composition of the Mississippi
soils see table in <a href="#Page_93">chapt. 6, p. 93</a>). A highly
ferruginous soil from Oahu shows plainly the effect of that substance.</p>

It will be noted that the greater fineness of grain in the Washington
dust soil induces a higher absorption of moisture than occurs in the
sandy soil from Mississippi, although the latter contains more clay.
Comparison of the figure for the Mississippi pipe-clay and clay soil
with the ferruginous soils, from the same state and from Oahu, indicate
plainly the influence of the ferric hydrate in increasing absorption;
although in the latter case the clay determination was not made,
because of the excess of ferric hydrate. The influence of humus is
plainly shown in the case of the marsh muck and soil, neither of which
contain any appreciable amount of either clay, or ferric hydrate in
the finely diffused condition. The relatively slight difference in the
absorptions of muck and soil is due to the only partial humification of
the organic matter in the former, while in the soil the humification is
sensibly complete, and the sand forming the body of the material serves
to render it more loose.</p>

<p>These data, referring to natural materials, while not as complete
as could be desired, are sufficient to prove the facts, and seem
preferable to any artificially devised imitation of their kind.</p>

<p><i>Influence of Temperature, and Degree of Air-Saturation.</i>—The
amount of moisture absorbed varies materially both with the
temperature, and with the degree of saturation of the air to which the
soil is exposed. Schübler, Knop and other earlier observers, operating
with earth exposed to air only partly saturated, and with soil layers
of considerable thickness (in watch glasses), found that the absorption
decreased as the temperature increased, according to a law formulated
by Knop. The writer found that under the conditions established in the
experiments of Knop and others, the air was not nearly saturated,<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
so that these determinations are marred by ineliminable faults, the
more as the soils used are only designated in general terms, as “garden
soil,” “loam,” “peaty land,” etc., without any definite indication of
their actual physical or chemical constitution. The writer therefore
undertook to correlate these coefficients, determined with respect to
completely saturated air, with the physical composition of certain
soils, as determined by means of the methods heretofore described.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span></p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">Some of the data so obtained are given in
the table of physical soil composition on <a href="#Page_93">page 93, chapt. 6</a>.
They have since been extensively supplemented by additional determinations,
but without materially changing the coefficients approximately
corresponding to the several designations accepted in farm practice.
Experiments conducted by the writer have conclusively shown that Knop’s
law of decrease of absorption with rise of temperature not only is
not true for <i>fully</i> saturated air, but must be reversed; the
fact being that the amount of water absorbed by the soil <i>increases
in a fully saturated atmosphere</i> (i.e., in presence of excess of
water) <i>as the temperature rises</i>, at least between 15
and 35 degrees Cent. Thus, fine sandy soil which at 15° absorbed 2%
of moisture, took up 4% at 34°; while loam soil absorbing 7% at 15°,
showed nearly 9% at 35°; an increase of 2% in each case. But in
partially saturated air<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
it was found that, as stated by Knop, the amounts absorbed steadily
decrease, though not according to the law announced by him. Taking
as a unit the moisture absorbed at 15°, it was found that in air
three-fourths saturated, ¾ of the unit was taken up by the soil; at
half saturation, nearly the proportional amount; but at one-fourth
saturation the earths absorb materially more than a similar proportion,
being then capable of withdrawing moisture from greatly undersaturated
air. Since air thus undersaturated occurs not uncommonly in the arid
regions of the world, the fact that the soil cannot be farther dried by
such air of the same temperature, is of some practical significance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
In view of the highly variable composition of soils and of the
doubtless varying hygroscopic properties of their several physical
constituents, it is not to be expected that any one numerical law will
hold good exactly for all kinds of lands. Mineral powders, colloidal
clay, ferric hydrate, aluminic hydrate, the zeolites, humus, and
other hydrates known to occur, doubtless each follow a different
law in the absorption of moisture and gases; so as to modify the
hygroscopic properties<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
of the soil in accordance with their relative predominance in each
case. (See table of absorption of gases, <a href="#Page_267">chapter 14</a>).</p>

<p><i>Utility of Hygroscopic Moisture to Plant-growth.</i>—The early
experimenters considered the hygroscopic moisture of the soil to be
of very great importance to the welfare of crops. Within the last
twenty-five years much doubt has been cast upon this claim, even to
the extent of stating that “the hygroscopic efficacy of soils must
be definitely eliminated from among the useful properties” (Mayer’s
Agriculturchemie, vol. 2, p. 131). Yet Mayer himself concedes the
cogency of the experiments made by Sachs, which proved that dry soil
immersed in a (probably not even fully) saturated atmosphere is capable
of supplying the requirements of normal vegetation; thus explaining
the obvious beneficial effects on vegetation of the summer fogs
prevailing in portions of the arid region, <i>e. g.</i>; on the coasts
of California and Chile.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span></p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">Mayer’s experiments relied upon to prove
the uselessness of hygroscopic moisture to plant growth, were carried
out in flower-pots, in which it was plainly shown that the plants
wilted before even the visible liquid (capillary) moisture of the
earth was entirely exhausted. But this simply proves that under such
artificial conditions, plants cannot withdraw moisture from the soil
<i>rapidly</i> enough for their needs. In <i>nature</i>, and notably
in the arid regions, the chief supply of water is received through
the deep-going main roots, while the bulk of the active feeding roots
of the plant may be surrounded by almost air-dry soil; under which
conditions, as Henrici (Henneberg’s Journ., 1863, p. 280) has shown,
slow growth and nutrition occurs even in such plants as the raspberry,
a native of humid climates. But in the arid region this is the normal
condition of the native vegetation through most of the rainless summer.
That a higher moisture-coefficient does not necessarily imply that a
larger amount of moisture can be withdrawn from the soil by the plants,
is undoubtedly true in some, but not in all cases; for in soils rich
in humus, the moisture is more freely shared with the roots than in
non-humous, clay lands.</p>

<p>The higher moisture-absorption is however of the most unquestionable
service in the case of the occurrence of the hot, dry winds that so
frequently threaten the entire crops of some regions. In this case the
soil containing the greater amount of moisture requires a much longer
time to be dried, and heated up to the point of injury to the roots,
than in the case of sandy soils of low absorptive power, whose store
is exhausted in a few hours and then permits the surface to be heated
up to the scalding point, searing the stems and root crowns. That such
injury occurs much sooner in sandy lands than in well-cultivated clay
soils, is a matter of common note in the arid region.</p>

<p><i>Summary.</i>—The significance of hygroscopic moisture in connection
with plant growth may then be thus summarized:</p>

<p>1. Soils of high hygroscopic power can withdraw from moist air enough
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
moisture to be of material help in <i>sustaining</i> the life of
vegetation in rainless summers, or in time of drought. It cannot,
however, maintain normal growth, save in the case of some desert plants.</p>

<p>2. High moisture-absorption prevents the rapid and undue heating of the
surface soil to the danger point, and thus often saves crops that are
lost in soils of low hygroscopic power.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Capillary Water.</span></h4>

<p>The liquid water held in the pores of the soil, in the form of surface
films representing the curved surface seen in capillary tubes, and
therefore tending to cause the water to move upwards, as well as in
all other directions, until uniformity of tension is established, is
of vastly higher importance to plant growth than hygroscopic moisture.
It not only serves normally as the vehicle of all plant food absorbed
during the growth of the usual crops, but also, as a rule, to sustain
the enormous evaporation by which the plant maintains during the heat
of the day, a temperature sufficiently low to permit of the proper
operation of the processes of assimilation and building of cell tissue.</p>

<p>Comparatively few plants have roots adapted to healthy action while
submerged in water, excluding them from free access of the oxygen of
the air; and when such roots are formed by plants not naturally growing
in water or swampy ground, they differ so far from earth-roots in
their structure that when transferred to soil they usually die, normal
earth-roots being gradually formed instead. Conversely, there is for
all land plants a definite time-limit beyond which their roots cannot
live, or at least remain healthy, in submersion. Thus grain fields
will with difficulty recover from a week’s total submersion; while
young rice fields will resist considerably longer. When in the resting
(winter) condition vineyards will bear submergence for thirty-five and
even forty days, deciduous orchards about three weeks; but when in the
growing condition, injury is suffered much more quickly.</p>

<p>It follows that whenever the soil-pores remain completely filled with
water for a length of time, there is danger to the welfare of nearly
all plants commonly cultivated in the temperate zones. It is therefore
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
important to know how much water will bring about this undesirable
condition in the different kinds of soil.</p>

<p>To determine this point we may either employ the determination of pore
space by a comparison of the density of the soil constituents (see
<a href="#Page_107">chap. 7, p. 107</a>) with the volume weight of the soil; or we
may measure directly the amount of water required to fill the pore-space. For the
latter purpose it is only necessary to measure the amount of water
(conveniently flowing from a graduated pipette) which, rising slowly
from below in a U-shaped tube so as to expel all the air before it, is
required to fill a definite weight or volume of the soil entirely full,
so as to rise to its surface. We thus ascertain the amount of empty
space existing within the soil,<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
which in the absence of water will ordinarily be filled by air.</p>

<p>In most cultivated soils, as already stated, the air-space constitutes
about 25% to 50% of their volume; and this space when filled with water
represents what is commonly termed their <i>maximum water capacity</i>
or saturation point. It is of interest to know this, because it has
been ascertained from experience that in order that plants may reach
their best development, the capillary water present should not amount
to more than 60%, or less than 40% of its maximum water-holding
capacity; thus leaving about half the pore-space filled with air. This
optimum, however, varies somewhat for different plants, some, like
celery, being more tolerant of excess, and others being more tolerant
of a deficiency of moisture, as is the, <i>e. g.</i>, egg-plant,
originally a desert growth.</p>

<p><i>Capillary Ascent of Water in Soil Columns.</i>—When a column of
dry soil (e. g., contained in a glass tube closed with muslin at the
lower end) is brought in contact with water, the latter is soon seen
to ascend in the soil, wetting it and thus changing its color so as
to permit of ready observation of its progress. At first the rise is
comparatively rapid, in some cases as much as an inch in one minute;
but it soon slows down and after a time ranging from a few days to many
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
months, reaches a maximum height beyond which the liquid water will
not rise. The ascent is most rapid, and stops soonest, in coarse sandy
soils; it rises most slowly, but in the end considerably higher, in
heavy clay soils. The most rapid continuous rise, and ultimately the
highest, occurs in salty soils containing but a small proportion of
clay. The maximum height of capillary rise thus far observed, viz.
10.17 feet, was noted in the case of quartz tailings from a stamp mill,
ranging from .005 mm. to .016 mm. in diameter; but it took about 18
months’ time to reach this maximum. The excessively fine texture of
clay opposes great frictional resistance to the movement of the water,
and the same is true of the finest silts, which, like clay, remain
almost indefinitely suspended in water. But it must be remembered that
while pure grains of silt will in wetting remain unchanged in size,
clay particles, and the clay incrusting silt grains, will on wetting
swell greatly, and thus fill up the interstices, largely closing them
up against the passage of water.</p>

<p>These facts are exemplified and graphically illustrated below.</p>

<p>The soils selected for this illustration, from California localities,
are the following:</p>

<p><i>No. 233.</i> Very sandy soil from near Morano, Stanislaus County.
Typical of the noted wheat-growing region of the lower San Joaquin
Valley, from northern Merced to Southern San Joaquin Counties; bench or
plains lands. First foot.</p>

<p><i>No. 1197.</i> Sandy alluvial soil from near the confluence of the
Gila and Colorado rivers, near Yuma. Very deep, light and easily
cultivated. First foot, but almost identical to 15 feet.</p>

<p><i>No. 168.</i> Silty alluvial soil from the old alluvium of the Santa
Clara River, near Santa Paula, Ventura County. Very deep, very easily
tilled; a typical alluvial loam of the arid region.</p>

<p><i>No. 1697.</i> Black adobe or clay soil, from the experiment station
grounds, Berkeley. A heavy clay soil, originally a swamp deposit,
becoming very tenacious when wet. An excellent wheat soil.</p>

<p>The most striking feature in this diagram is the very rapid<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
and high ascent in the combination of sediments represented by the Gila
bottom soil. It outstrips at once both the sandy soil from Stanislaus,
which contains a trifle less of clay, and the silt soil from Ventura,
from which at first sight it does not seem to differ widely, but which
contains considerably more clay. It is doubtless the latter which so
greatly retards the motion of the water, as is still farther seen in
the case of the clay or adobe soil. It will be noted that on the second
and third days, the Gila soil had raised the water nearly twice as
high as the adobe, and that it took only 18 hours to raise it nearly
the same height as that attained by the Ventura silt in so many days.
But it ceased to rise after the 125th day, while the Ventura soil,
continuing for 195 days, finally rose 3 inches higher. The adobe also
continued its rise, but did not reach the same height as the Gila soil
by nearly two inches. There can be no doubt that the energetic and high
rise of the latter proves an important factor in the culture of these lands.</p>

<p>The coarse sandy soil reached its highest limit, 16½ inches, within six
days, when the silty Gila soil stood at about double that height.

<p><i>Ascent of Water in uniform</i><a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
<i>Sediments.</i>—Loughridge has ascertained the rate of ascent of
uniform sediments of different grain-diameters, with the results
shown in the diagram subjoined, together with the maximum height
reached by each. The diagram is very eloquently illustrative of the
great differences in the capillary properties of granular sediments
of the various grades; and it would seem that it ought to be possible
to deduce from it by a somewhat complex formula the rate and height
of ascent of water in any soil of known physical composition. In
nature, however, the presence of clay and the greater or less degree
of flocculation of mixed sediments will always vitiate to a very
great extent the results deducible from such calculations; hence the
data conveyed by the observations of Loughridge must be considered
applicable only to granular sediments free from clay and entirely
deflocculated.</p>

<p>It is curious that in this case the “clay” showed a rise markedly below
that of the finest granular sediment, despite the extreme fineness of
its particles. This proves plainly that the physical nature of colloid
clay is unlike that of the granular sediments; as has been repeatedly
mentioned above.</p>

<p><i>Maximum and Minimum of Water-holding Power.</i>—It is clear that
at the base of the columns of soils just considered, the maximum of
water-absorption of which the soil is capable will have been brought
about; while at the top of the same column, the minimum of possible
liquid absorption (continuous films of water) will exist. The same
minimum moisture-condition will be produced when a limited quantity of
water is placed with a large mass of soil; the moisture will spread
to certain limits, until the surface films of water have all acquired
uniform tension; and will then cease to extend, except by evaporation
and hygroscopic absorption.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
It is clear that the same condition will be brought about in the course
of time at the top of a soil column in which water has percolated
from above; and hence the minimum mentioned, aside from evaporation,
represents approximately the usual condition of the soil near the
surface within a variable time after a rain, or irrigation, when
the descending water column has attained a length corresponding to
the height to which the water would have risen from below in a tube
arranged as shown on <a href="#Page_205">p. 205</a>. It is therefore
a condition of very frequent occurrence in the arid region.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
<i>Capillary Water held at Different Heights in a Soil Column.</i>—To
determine the amounts of water held in the different portions in
columns of soils in which water ascends by capillary rise, the
following plan was adopted by the writer in collaboration with
Loughridge (Rep. Calif. Sta. 1892-4, p. 99).</p>

<p>Instead of glass tubes the soils to be tested were placed in copper
tubes one inch in diameter, divided into segments six inches long,
and flattened on one side. In the flattened side a slot half an inch
wide was left, and glass plates, held in position by rubber elastics,
were cemented on the slotted side by means of paraffin, to prevent a
sifting-out of the soil. The short sections can be connected at the
ends like joints of stove-pipe, and the earths can be easily introduced
in proper, even condition. It was thus possible to gain access to any
portion of the column at any time, for the taking of samples.</p>

<div class="blockquot fs_90">
<p>Since gravity limits the capillary ascent in a progressive ratio,
as shown in diagram 39, it is obvious that the true <i>maximum</i>
saturation can exist only in a very short (strictly speaking, an
infinitesimally short) vertical column. The least practicable height
for experimental work being about 1 cm. (⅖ in.), the writer has adopted
for the purpose of rapid determination of this factor, the use of a
brass cylinder 1 cm. high and of such width as to contain, for the
sake of convenience, 25 or 50 cm. of soil. This cylinder has a finely
perforated bottom, which may be covered with filter paper; after being
filled with soil which has been struck level, and weighing, it is
immersed to 1 mm. depth in distilled water and allowed to rest for an
hour; then quickly dried outside and beneath with filter paper, and
again weighed. The amount of water found by difference should for all
practical purposes be referred to the volume, not to the weight, of the
soil, so as to eliminate the error arising from the varying specific
gravity of the latter.</p>

<p>In most cases the surface of the soil in the sieve cylinder remains
level after wetting; but sometimes it swells so as to rise above its
dry level, even to the extent of nearly 30% (<a href="#Page_114">see chapter 7, p. 114</a>).
This happens especially in strongly ferruginous soils. In the case of
“black alkali” soils, in wetting an enormous <i>collapse</i> sometimes
takes place (<a href="#Page_422">see chapter 22</a>).</p>

<p>If it be desired to determine also the <i>minimum</i> liquid
absorption (see below), the surface of the wet soil is first covered
with air-dry soil, to absorb the surplus moisture, and finally with
soil previously saturated with hygroscopic moisture; the added soil
being each time thrown off and finally the surface “struck” level with
a tense silk thread before weighing. Corrections must be applied for
the usual increase in weight, from the addition of soil, and for the
hygroscopic moisture.</p>
</div>

<p>While the <i>minimum</i> of liquid absorption can thus be determined
quickly, without awaiting the capillary ascent of a water column, and
if sufficient time is given can also be determined in higher columns,
as proposed by Mayer (Wollny’s Forsch. Vol. 3), the <i>maximum</i>
cannot thus be determined without gross inaccuracy. In determinations
made by the writer it was found that the figures for the minima of
very different soils (clayey and sandy) of the arid region, differ
proportionally much less than do the respective maxima. In few of these
soils it was found to exceed about 10 per cent, and it scarcely fell
below 4 per cent even in very sandy soils. A very deep, sandy soil,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
which had been irrigated in May, and upon which no rain had since
fallen, showed in July in the second foot, upon which rested ten inches
of fully air-dried soil free from vegetation, a water-percentage of
eight per cent.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p><i>Capillary Action in Moist Soils.</i>—In the preceding discussion
the case of columns of air-dry soils, so common in the arid regions,
has been considered. It is obvious that a soil column holding the
<i>minimum</i> of capillary water may be of any height; so that
when, as happens in the open field, the rain water soaks down beyond
the range of capillary rise in a given soil, the upper portions
of the latter, above that range, will remain at the minimum of
moisture-content so long as it is not depleted by evaporation. King has
made extended observations on soil columns ten feet high and moistened
throughout the mass. Capillary movement takes place in moist soils much
more rapidly than in dry ones, although when sufficient time is given
the final adjustment will of course be the same. King’s experiments
showed that evaporation at the surface of the tenfoot columns caused
a sensible depletion of the water content originally existing at the
depth of ten feet, in the course of 314 days. While so slow a movement
might not be of any benefit during the growth-period of shallow-rooted
annual crops, the fact shown is of importance to permanent plantings,
as of trees and vines.</p>

<p>Another and not so readily intelligible effect observed by King is
that when the surface-soil is wetted, moisture may be withdrawn toward
the surface from the lower layers. In one experiment he found that
when water was applied on the surface so as to add two pounds of water
to <i>each</i> surface foot in several soils, at the end of 26 hours
there had been an increase of <i>three</i> pounds in the same, and a
loss of one and three quarter pounds from the second and third feet.
The cause of this translocation is probably a “distillation” of the
subsoil moisture toward the cooled soil; the fact that it occurs is of
practical interest, since it seems to show that wetting the upper
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
portion of the soil by cold rain or irrigation may tend to raise
additional supplies from below. At the change of seasons we not
uncommonly find, in digging tree holes or wells, a wet streak at from
9 to 18 inches below the surface, caused evidently by the condensation
of subsoil moisture, at the limit of a cold zone resulting from the
penetration of unseasonable temperature (“cold snap”) from above. Such
movements of soil-moisture by means of evaporation and recondensation
within the soil can of course take place even when the minimum of
liquid absorption has been reached and direct capillary movement has
ceased. It is, as it were, dew within the soil.</p>

<p><i>Proportion of Moisture Available to Growing Plants.</i>—Not all the
capillary moisture contained in soils is available to plants, as can
readily be seen from the fact that many plants, especially when growing
in pots, begin to wilt while the soil still appears visibly moist. The
limit of wilting differs greatly in different plants, and in the open
ground it is difficult to ascertain that limit, because the deeper
roots continue to supply moisture from moister substrata. Hence potted
plants wilt while the soil appears much moister than when the same grow
in the field. King<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
has determined the amounts of moisture down to 43 inches in a Wisconsin
soil in which clover and corn were at the wilting point, as in the
following condensed table:</p>

<p>It is plainly shown here that the roots of clover and corn were unable
to utilize the higher moisture-content of the subsoil-clay to the same
extent as the smaller amounts present in the surface foot, and in the
sandy substrata. Evidently the moisture in the clay soil was more
tenaciously retained.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span></p>

<p>This is doubtless due, as King shows, to the equal thinness of the
moisture film remaining on the soil grains in either case; the number
of grains, and therefore the aggregate surface holding these films,
being much greater in the clay than in sands; hence the higher water
content.</p>

<p>It is interesting to compare these figures given by King for clover
and maize at the wilting-point, and fallow ground adjacent, with those
given by Eckart (Rep. Expt. Sta. Haw. Sugar Planters’ Ass’n., 1903) for
those affording good growing conditions for sugar-cane on the (highly
ferruginous) soils of that station. The plots were irrigated at the
rate of one, two and three inches of water per week, allowance being
made for the rainfall. Two inches proved, on the whole, to give the
best average results for production. The moisture determination of
the soil under the two-inch regime gave an average moisture content
of 29.13% in the first foot of soil. It is not stated what was the
hygroscopic coefficient of that soil, but it was probably very high;
in the neighborhood of 21.5%, judging by the determinations made with
six Hawaiian soils at the California Station. This would indicate about
7.63% of free moisture as the optimum for sugar-cane.</p>

<p><i>Moisture-requirements of Crops in the Arid Region.</i>—Plants
(particularly broad-leaved ones) which have made a brash growth during
a period of abundant moisture, will wilt quickly when sunshine returns,
and take some time to adapt themselves to the drier conditions. On the
other hand, plants accustomed to dry air and scanty soil-moisture,
will not wilt or suffer under what would elsewhere be considered very
rigorous conditions. Loughridge<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
has made numerous determinations of moisture in soils in which crops
were beginning to suffer, and others on similar soils that were growing
normally, and found that in general, not only were the differences in
moisture content considerably less than in the case above quoted from
King’s observations, but that the amounts of free moisture required
by various crops in the arid climate of California were surprisingly small.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
The tables below show the results of observations made by Loughridge
during several drought years in California; so arranged as to show the
differences of moisture content for the same crop in different soils.
It will be observed that in all cases where a crop growing on a clay
soil could be compared with the same on a lighter soil, the moisture
required to keep the crop in good condition was very much greater in
the clay than in the loam or sandy soils. In the case of apples, <i>e.
g.</i>, 8.3% of water was abundant to keep the trees in excellent
condition on a loam soil, while on a clay soil holding 12.3% the
condition was very poor. That this difference is due in the main to the
difference in the hygroscopic-moisture coefficient of the respective
soils, is plainly apparent in several cases. It is therefore not the
<i>total</i> moisture content, but the free moisture present in excess
of what is held by hygroscopic absorption, that determines the welfare
of the plant.</p>

<p>By determining, first, the total moisture in the soils, as taken in
the field, then, after allowing them to become air-dry, determining
the maximum of hygroscopic moisture they would absorb (<a href="#Page_198">see p. 198</a>),
Loughridge found by difference the amount of free moisture, or liquid
water which must be present in the soil to prevent the crops from
suffering. An exceptionally good opportunity for these observations
was offered by the dry season of 1898, during which crops suffering
and not suffering, on identical lands, could easily be found. The
determinations were always made for each foot of the upper four feet
of the land in the immediate neighborhood of the trees or among the
field crops. The first table exemplifies the method of procedure; the
second gives the summary of results for the several crops and trees, as
calculated from observations made during the season.

<span class="h_subtitle">THE WATER OF SOILS.—<i>Continued.</i></span></h3>
</div>

<h4>SURFACE, HYDROSTATIC AND GROUND WATER;<br> PERCOLATION.</h4>

<p>Since all the water of soils and plants is directly or indirectly
derived from the rainfall (including therein snow and hail), some
general points regarding this factor require first consideration. While
it is not the object of this work to discuss climatology in detail,
yet the times of the year and the manner in which precipitation comes,
acts upon and is disposed of in the soil under different climatic
conditions, must of necessity form an essential part of its subject
matter.</p>

<p><i>Amount of rainfall.</i>—The rain falling in the course of a year
is usually stated in the form of “inches” (or centimeters), implying
the height of the water column that would be shown at the end of the
year had it all been allowed to accumulate; or, the sum of all the
successive rains (including snow) observed during the year. Since
this amount ranges all the way from nothing, or a mere fraction of an
inch (as in portions of the Andes, and of the great African and Asian
deserts) to as much as 600 inches or fifty feet (Cherapundji in eastern
India), the adaptation of agricultural practice to the maintenance
of the proper moisture-supply to crops is largely a local question,
oftentimes of not inconsiderable difficulty. This is especially the
case where torrential rains, yielding several inches of rain in a few
hours, alternate with light, soaking rainfall, as is very commonly the
case in the interior of continents, and more especially in the United
States east of the Rocky Mountains. Westward of the same the rainfall
decreases so rapidly that at or about the one-hundredth meridian (the
longitude of Bismark and Pierre, Dakota, and Dodge City, Kansas) we
already reach the annual average of 20 inches, which is commonly
assumed to be the limit below which crops cannot safely be grown
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
without irrigation. The “cloudbursts” occasionally occurring within
these limits are usually confined to mountainous regions, and the
water they pour down on the dry soil is rarely of any direct benefit
to agriculture; hence they cannot be properly counted in the general
estimate of the effective rainfall. A region of high rainfall (up to
100 inches and over), however, extends along the Pacific coast from
northern California through western Oregon and Washington across
British Columbia to Alaska, to seaward of the Sierra Nevada, Cascade,
and Alaskan coast ranges.</p>

<p>In the country east of the Mississippi river, the average annual
rainfall ranges from 30 inches in the region of the Great Lakes, and
45 to 50 inches on the north Atlantic coast, to 60 inches in Louisiana
and up to eighty in southern Florida. The average of the Mississippi
Valley and Atlantic coast States is usually stated at about 45 inches,
which is distributed more or less evenly throughout the year, excepting
usually from six to eight weeks of more scanty precipitation in the
latter part of August and in September—the “Indian summer” season; so
that the winter is the season of greatest total rainfall.</p>

<p><i>Natural disposition of the Rain Water.</i>—The rainfall is
naturally first disposed of in two ways, viz., a portion which is
absorbed by the soil, and another which is at once shed from the
surface and constitutes the “surface runoff.” The portion absorbed into
the soil is subsequently disposed of either by soakage downward into
the subdrainage and through springs and seepage<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
into the streams and rivers; or by evaporation. The latter again occurs
in two different ways, viz., from the soil-surface itself, or through
the roots and leaves of plants. The importance of each of these modes
is sufficiently great to entitle each to detailed consideration.</p>

<p><i>The Surface Runoff.</i>—This portion of the disposal of rain may
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
range all the way from nothing to almost totality, according to the
nature of the soil and the condition of its surface.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
Sandy soils, especially when coarse, may absorb instantly even a
very heavy rainfall. Heavy clay soils when dry will at first also
absorb quickly quite a heavy precipitation; but as the beating of the
raindrops compacts the surface, the absorption quickly slows down, so
that heavy downpours of brief duration, while wetting thoroughly into
a plastic mass the first two or three inches of a clay soil, may leave
all beneath dry, to be very gradually moistened by the slow downward
percolation against the resistance of the air in the soil; while the
greater part of the later portion of the shower will drain off the
surface in muddy runlets. Certain soils classed as loams, having
the property of crusting readily by rain followed by sunshine
(<a href="#Page_111">see chapter 7, p. 111</a>), in heavy showers
behave hardly better than strong clay soils; shedding the water until
the soaked crust gives way, and is carried off in muddy streamlets.
Then begins the cutting-away of the soil that, in portions of the
Cotton States, as well as north of the Ohio river, has been the cause
of extensive devastation of once fruitful culture lands, the site of
which is now marked by “red washes” and gullies but too familiar to the
eye in many regions, especially of the southern United States.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquot fs_90">
<p><i>Washing-away and Gullying in the Cotton States.</i>—Nowhere
perhaps have these effects been so severely felt as in portions of
northwestern and central Mississippi, and this case is so instructive
as to deserve a more detailed description. In the regions in question
the soil stratum consists of a yellow or brownish loam from three to
seven feet in original thickness, constituting a very desirable class
of gently rolling uplands, which at one time claimed to be the best
cotton-growing portion of the State. It was originally covered with an
open forest of oaks, with an abundant growth of grasses that afforded
excellent pasture to deer and cattle; a natural park gay with flowers
during most of the season.</p>

<p>When these lands were taken into cultivation little or no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
attention was paid to the direction of the furrows and rows of corn and
cotton; most commonly the plowing was done “up-hill and down,” so that
the “dead-furrow” afforded a ready opportunity for the formation of
washes cutting into the subsoil, during the torrential rains sometimes
falling during the summers. Even when filled with soil by plowing,
these washes would frequently re-open during rains, shedding the
soil in a muddy flood upon the lower lands. The washing-away of the
surface soil, thus brought about, of course diminished the production
of the higher lands, which were then commonly “turned out” and left
without cultivation or care of any kind. The crusted surface shed the
rain water into the old furrows, and the latter were quickly deepened
and widened into gullies—“red washes”—whose presence rendered any
resumption of cultivation difficult. In the course of a few years the
soil-stratum of brown loam was penetrated into the loose or loosely
cemented sand which underlies it almost everywhere, and is very readily
washed away. Soon the water, gaining yearly in volume, undercut the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
loam stratum so as to cause it to “cave” into gullies in huge masses,
which with the sand were carried into the valleys adjacent, filling
the beds of the streams so as to cause their flow to disappear under
the flood of sand. As the evil progressed, large areas of uplands were
denuded completely of their loam or culture stratum, leaving nothing
but bare, arid sand, wholly useless for cultivation; while the valleys
were little better, the native vegetation having been destroyed and
only hardy weeds finding nourishment on the sandy surface.</p>
</div>

    <p class="f90"><span class="smcap">Fig. 40a.</span>—Erosion in Mississippi
        Table Lands, causing<br> destruction of agricultural value both of
        Uplands and Valleys.<br> (McGee, 12th Ann. Rept. U. S. G. S., 1890-91.)</p>
</div>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">In this manner whole sections, and in some
portions of the State whole townships of the best class of uplands
have been transformed into sandy wastes, hardly reclaimable by any
ordinary means, and wholly changing the industrial conditions of entire
counties; whose county seats even in some instances had to be changed,
the old town and site having, by the same destructive agencies,
literally “gone down hill.” This destruction of lands was greatly
aggravated by the civil war, during which, and for some time after,
large areas of lands once under cultivation were left to the mercy of
the elements.</p>

<p><i>Injury in the arid regions.</i>—In the arid regions, where the
rainfall frequently comes in heavy downpours or “cloudbursts,” immense
damage to pasture lands has been brought about by overstocking, in
Arizona and New Mexico; involving the destruction of the natural cover
of vegetation and the loosening of the surface especially by sheep;
after which a heavy rainfall will carry off the surface soil, the muddy
water being gathered largely in the trails made by cattle going to
water. Thus gradually gullies are formed, which enlarging more and more
become ravines and cut up the pasture slopes into “bad lands,” useless
equally for pasture and for agriculture.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
California, eastern Oregon and Washington, and Montana, offer striking
and lamentable examples of the same destructive agencies.</p>

<p><i>Deforestation.</i>—The deforestation of hill and mountain lands
has, the world over, led to similar results; causing not only the
destruction of pasture and agricultural lands, but also the conversion
of streams, flowing from springs and seepage all the year, into
periodic torrents, flooding the lowlands during rains by the rapid
running-off of the water from the bare and hard-baked mountain slopes,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
and then running dry within a short time, so as not even to afford
drinking water to pasturing cattle in summer. Thus for half a century
the unsolved problem of the “correction of the waters of the Jura
mountains” was before the Swiss and French governments; and the great
and costly public work involving re-forestation, deflection of torrents
and filling-in of deep ravines and gullies, is not even yet nearly
completed. In Spain, which in the time of the Roman occupation was
largely a forest country with abundant rainfall, the same results are
seen, notably in the South, in the wide, and mostly dry, sandy beds
of streams once running deep and clear; and in the scarred hill-and
mountain-sides, and scant vegetation of low shrubs (“chaparral”) that
replace the once abundant tree growth, <i>e. g.</i>, in Old and New
Castile. Unfortunately the lessons taught by the bitter experience of
the old world seem to require actual repetition in the new, before
means of prevention are even thought of.</p>

<p><i>Prevention of Injury to Cultivated Lands from excessive
Runoff.</i>—The fundamental remedy for the injurious effects of
excessive runoff from the land surface is, of course, to facilitate
its absorption into the soil to the utmost extent possible, by deep
tillage; or in cases where this is undesirable (as when in rainy
climates excessive leaching of the land is feared), to so direct
and control the surface drainage that its flow shall nowhere be so
rapid as to carry with it any large amounts of earth, or to wash out
the furrows. To this end its fall must be diminished by “circling,”
<i>i. e.</i>, plowing nearly at right angles to the slope instead of
up-and-down, and on steep slopes especially also by maintaining open
furrows or ditches having a gentle fall only, into which the water can
shed and flow off quietly in case the furrows, left in plowing, prove
insufficient to retain and shed gradually the water they cannot hold
permanently. The early adoption of this simple expedient would have
wholly prevented the enormous waste of fine agricultural lands referred

<p>The underdraining of lands liable to washing is a costly but highly
effective means of preventing denudation; and the laying of underdrains
in gullies already formed, to prevent farther deepening, is among the
most obvious means of arresting farther damage. The beneficial effects
of underdrainage in conserving moisture will be discussed farther on.

<h4>ABSORPTION AND MOVEMENTS OF<br> WATER IN SOILS.</h4>

<p>The phenomena and laws of capillary ascent of water in soils, as
discussed in the preceding chapter, serve best to demonstrate the
general behavior of liquid water within different soils and their
several grain-sizes; because measurably independent of the physical
changes that almost unavoidably accompany the percolation of water
from above downward; whether such water comes in the form of rain,
or irrigation, or even when applied with the utmost precautions in
the laboratory. The “beating” of rains quickly compacts the surface
to a certain extent, varying with the nature of the soil, its
condition of more or less perfect tilth, and the degree of violence
with which the rain strikes the surface. When the latter has been
compacted by a previous rain and then dried, “baking” or incrusting
the surface, the latter may almost wholly shed a rain of brief
duration, which, had the surface been loose, would have been wholly
absorbed, materially benefiting the crop. Such surface-crusting is,
therefore, injurious in preventing the absorption of water from above;
and in addition, it serves to waste, by evaporation, the moisture
contained in the underlying soil and subsoil. For the crust being of
a finer (single-grain) texture than the tilled portion beneath, it
will forcibly abstract from the latter, by absorption, its capillary
moisture, and evaporating it at the upper surface, continue to deplete
the land, to the great injury of crop growth, until destroyed by
cultivation.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>The flow of irrigation water produces the same compacting effect, but
to a less extent; the more as, unlike rain water, irrigation water
usually contains a certain amount of alkaline and earth salts, which
tend to prevent the diffusion of clay and of fine sediments, and
therefore the disintegration of the soil-floccules into single grains.
Nevertheless, it is in some soils as necessary to cultivate after
surface-irrigation as after rains, in order to prevent great waste of
moisture by evaporation.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span></p>

<p><i>Determination of rate of percolation.</i>—When water is allowed
to soak into an air-dry soil column without sensible shock or motion,
from a constant level, we obtain the nearest approach to a definite
determination of the relative permeability of soils to water under
the conditions usual in the arid region. A number of determinations
thus made is tabulated in the diagram given below, which embodies the
observations made by Mr. A. V. Stubenrauch<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> in connection with a more
extended investigation.</p>

<div class="blockquot fs_90">
<p>As these experiments were made with soils not in their field
condition, but gently broken up with a rubber pestle, a standard of
compactness was established by weighing the quantity which could
conveniently be settled into a tube space of 100 centimeters capacity
by tapping the sides and bottom of the tube, without touching the soil
itself. In this way the following standards were established: For the
University Adobe soil, 140 grams; for the Yuba loam soil, 110 grams;
for the Stanislaus sandy soil, 170 grams. Tubes 1½ inches wide were
used, and the soils were introduced in bulk, inside of a cylinder of
stiff paper upon which previously to rolling it up the soils had been
thoroughly mixed. After introducing the soil-filled paper roll it was
gently withdrawn, leaving the soil column in the tube as uniform as
before; a condition almost impossible of fulfilment when the soil is
introduced piece-meal. The tubes were, of course, left open at the
lower end, using a wire netting to keep the soil column in, so that the
air could escape freely before the descending water column.</p>

<p>The results thus obtained do not, of course, apply directly to the
same soils undisturbed in place in the field; where, moreover, the air
is confined by the wetting of the surface and thus directly opposes
penetration of the water. Still, they doubtless give a correct idea
of their <i>relative</i> permeability for water when in the tilled
condition. The water level was automatically maintained at the depth of
half an inch above the surface of the soil columns. Pore-spaces given
are calculated from volume-weight and specific gravity.</p>
</div>

<p>This diagram shows plainly that there is no direct relation between
the total pore-space in a soil and the facility of water-penetration.
The highest pore-space, in the fine-grained alluvial loam, allows more
rapid percolation than the heavy clay or adobe soil, but is greatly
exceeded by the coarser sandy soil. In all it is very apparent that the
downward movement slows down as the water descends, doubtless because
the great friction in a longer column gradually diminishes the effect
of hydrostatic pressure. It may be presumed that at a certain distance
from the surface the downward movement becomes practically uniform, and
independent of the pressure from above.

        differences in<br> rates of percolation through different soils.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
<i>Summary.</i>—Two salient points are revealed by even a cursory
inspection of the preceding diagram, viz.:</p>

<p>1. The downward percolation is most rapid in the same soils in which
the capillary ascent is quickest, that is, in the coarse, sandy soil.</p>

<p>2. The rapidity of percolation decreases materially as the wetted soil
column increases in length.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">The first point is readily foreseen and
needs no comment. As regards the second, it results from the fact that
as the wetted column lengthens the frictional resistance increasingly
counteracts the effects of the hydrostatic pressure from above, until
the water’s descent becomes but little more rapid than would be its
lateral diffusion, or its ascent at the end of a similar column
supplied by capillary rise from below. In both cases the frictional
resistance has so far counteracted the effect of gravity that the
capillary coefficients of the soil-material become the controlling
factors of the water movement.</p>

<p><i>Influence of Variety of Grain-sizes.</i>—King (Physics of
Agriculture, pp. 159, 160), compared the rapidity of the percolation
of water through definitely graded pure sands on the one hand, and a
sandy loam and a clay soil on the other. The materials were arranged
in 8-foot columns fully saturated with water at the outset, and then
allowed to drain freely. The following abridged table shows the tenor
of his results:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
This table is very instructive in showing the great difference in the
rapidity of percolation in materials of uniform, even-sized grains,
as compared with such as contain particles of many different sizes,
in which the interspaces of the larger ones are filled more or less
closely by the smaller sizes of particles (<a href="#Page_109">see chapter 7, p. 109</a>).
While it is true that we have no definite physical analysis of the
soils here used, the differences are so great as to be sufficiently
striking. Compare the percolation through the sand of .155 mm. uniform
grain-size (a fine sand), during the first half hour, with that through
the sandy loam during the first 21 hours. Twice as much water has
passed from the sand as from the soil in one forty-second part of the
time. Comparing similarly the finest sand, .083 mm. in diameter, with
the clay loam, we find the difference to be as one to seventy-three.
It is thus evident that but for the variously assorted sizes of the
soil-particles, water would not be held long enough to supply plant
growth.</p>

<p><i>Percolation in Natural Soils.</i>—In artificial percolation
experiments, as well as during a fall of rain, the gradual settling
of the fully wetted soil-column produces a compacting of that portion
of the mass, that increasingly impedes the downward penetration. The
effect of this under natural conditions is readily seen in the fact
that after the first, rapid absorption of falling rain by the soil
when in good tilth, there is a gradual slackening of the process even
when the rain is fine and slow, causing a perceptible increase of the
runoff until, should the rain continue for some time, the absorption
becomes so slow as to cause all, or nearly all the water to drain off
the surface. The soil is then called “saturated,” having really arrived
at that point right at the surface, and to a depth varying according to
the duration and amount of rain, and the natural perviousness of the land.</p>

<p>When the rain ceases, the visible saturation of the surface usually
soon disappears in cultivated soils, and the zone of saturation begins
to descend. The progress of this descent may be very strikingly
observed in a series of holes (post-holes) dug or bored across a
ridge; as indicated in the subjoined schematic diagram, in which the
successive dotted lines represent the levels of the descending “bottom
water” at successive intervals, as derived from the observation of the
water levels in the several holes.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img id="FIG_42" src="images/image226.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="186" >
    <p class="f90"><span class="smcap">Fig. 42.</span>—Percolation in clay
             land after heavy rain.</p>
</div>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">It will be seen that while at first the
upper surface of the zone of saturation coincides with the surface of
the ground, in falling it descends most rapidly on the highest ground,
while at the lower levels the holes may remain full or overflowing;
the drainage taking place sideways as well as vertically. The
curved surface connecting the levels in the several holes gradually
flattens, rapidly at first, then progressively more slowly; the water
disappearing entirely, first from the holes lying highest, then
successively from those at lower levels; those located in valleys or
drainage channels remaining full until surface-water ceases to run in
such channels. But even after liquid water has ceased to be visible
in the holes, the descent of the water continues within that portion
of the soil, tending (unless more rain should come before that time),
to establish the condition of equilibrium as existing in the soil
columns shown in the diagram on <a href="#Page_205">p. 205, chapt. 11</a>; such
as results from the capillary ascent of water from below, but having above it a
column of soil of minimum water-content, of greater or less height
according to the length of time allowed for the water to descend. This
is a very common state of things during the long summer droughts in
the arid region, when neither rain nor irrigation has added to the
water supply in the soil for many months, and yet ordinary deciduous
fruit trees mature their normal crops. Frequently, however, before
this state of equilibrium is reached, evaporation from the surface so
draws upon the water supply within the first few feet, as to reduce the
soil to undersaturation at the lowest point of the descending column,
so stopping farther descent and soon reversing the direction of the
movement. The latter is the usual condition of scantily irrigated ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
<i>Ground or Bottom Water, Water Table.</i>—During and after
long-continued and abundant rains, the zone of supersaturation
continues to descend until it finally reaches a more or less permanent
level, varying somewhat from season to season, but on the whole usually
definable for each region and locality; being the depth to which wells
must be sunk in order to secure a fairly permanent water supply. This
is called the water table, ground water, bottom water, or “first
water.”<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
The proportion of the rainfall that reaches the permanent water level
varies enormously, of course, in different soils and at different
times. With brief and moderate rains, in soils of high water-holding
power and slow percolation, it may never reach the bottom-water level;
this is very commonly the case in the arid regions. Where, as in the
humid regions, rains are frequent or much prolonged, one half and even
more may finally reach the permanent level; runoff and evaporation
disposing of the balance.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90"><i>Lysimeters.</i>—For the determination
of the amount of water percolating to given depths, water-tight
receptacles called lysimeters are usually employed. The best way to
establish such receptacles is to isolate a unit-area (usually a square
meter) by digging all around it to the depth desired, then surrounding
it with a metal sheet soldered tightly at the cut edges, and finally
driving in a sharp-edged, stiff metal sheet so as to form the bottom
when soldered to the upright walls; leaving on one side an outlet
for the percolating water, which is then received into a measuring
receptacle somewhat like a rain gauge.</p>

<p>Hall (The Soil, p. 75) states that at Rothamstead, where an average
rainfall of 31.3 inches is distributed rather uniformly through the
season, and where the soil is a moderately clayey loam, a little less
than half percolates through 20 inches of soil, and about 45% through
60 inches.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span></p>

<p><i>Surface of Ground Water; Variations.</i>—The surface of the water
table, however, is rarely level except in level and very uniform
ground, or after long periods of drought. The undulations of its
surface conform, in general, to that of the ground surface, but are
less abrupt; so that the water lies nearer to the surface in low than
in high ground, as is indicated in the diagram above.</p>

<p>King<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
has shown, moreover, that the level of the ground water shows
sensible variations due to increased or diminished barometric pressure,
as well as to variations of temperature in the soil, which cause the
air in the pores to expand or contract to a degree sufficient to bring
about variations in the flow of springs and underdrains to the extent
of 8 and 15% respectively, in conformity with the daily changes of
temperature and pressure.</p>

<p><i>The Depth of the Ground Water most Favorable to Crops</i> cannot be
stated in a general manner, as it depends materially upon the nature of
the crop, its root habit, and the nature of the soil. As has already
been said, the amount of soil-moisture most favorable to plant growth
is about half of the maximum it can hold; and this condition, as is
shown in the table in <a href="#Page_208">chapter 11, p. 208</a>, is reached
about the middle of the maximum height to which the water can rise
by capillarity from the water level. Below this point the access
of air to the roots becomes too limited, and in case of continuous
rains the root-ends would soon begin to suffer from want of aeration.
On “sub-irrigated” land, therefore, which is generally considered
desirable, crops must be carefully selected with respect to their root
habits. Thus while alfalfa needs considerable moisture to do its best,
its deep-rooting habit renders it undesirable when the ground water is
at less than five feet depth; but red clover may be grown even with the
water level at three feet.</p>

<p>In clayey soils root-penetration is always less than in sandy lands;
and although in the former the capillary ascent of water goes higher
than in the latter, yet its movement in clays is so much slower than in
sandy materials that unless water is within comparatively easy reach,
the plants may suffer from drought. Experience has long ago fixed the
proper depth at which to lay underdrains limiting the rise of bottom
water, at from three to four and a half or even five feet in clay
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
soils; greater depths are only exceptionally used, partly because the
laying of drains then becomes too expensive.</p>

<p>A mass of four feet of clay-loam soil is commonly, then, considered
as sufficient to supply the needs of a crop; it being understood that
in the humid region at least, such soils are usually the richest in
plant food, so that a deeper range of the root system is not called
for. It is quite otherwise in the sandy soils of the same region, which
being usually poor in plant food, must afford a deeper penetration in
order that an adequate amount of the same shall be within reach of the
roots. Sandy lands, then, should be deep in order to repay cultivation;
and fortunately this is usually the case. But when this is otherwise;
when for instance a sandy soil four feet in depth is underlaid by
impervious clay, underdrains may be quite as necessary as in the clay
lands; since the depth of actually available soil mass would otherwise
be reduced to two or two and a half feet only, by the water stagnating
on the clay surface and rising from 16 to 24 inches in the sand. Soils
thus shallowed can with difficulty be maintained in good productive
condition even by the most energetic fertilization.</p>

<p><i>Moisture supplied by tap roots.</i>—In most cases, sandy lands do
not require underdraining; and in them, root-penetration may reach to
extraordinary depths in the case of certain plants, especially when
taprooted. Thus the roots of alfalfa (lucern) are very commonly found
to reach depths of twenty to twenty-five feet, and even sixty feet has
been credibly reported for the same plant in the arid region. It is
obvious that for such plants, a high level of bottom water is wholly
undesirable, since they are enabled to obtain their moisture supply
from great depths, and can thus utilize for their nutrition much larger
soil-masses than can shallow-rooted plants.</p>

<p><i>Reserve of Capillary Water.</i>—It must be remembered that it is
not only, nor usually, the bottom water that supplies moisture to plant
growth; for all soils of proper texture for cultivation retain within
them a certain amount of capillary moisture after the ground water has
reached its permanent level (<a href="#Page_226">see this chap. p. 226</a>),
and when the tap or main roots are plentifully supplied with water, the upper
and chief feeding roots draw but lightly upon the moisture within their immediate
reach for the purpose of leaf evaporation. This fact can be plainly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
observed in the arid region, when on the advent of the summer drought,
young plantlets whose tap roots have reached a certain depth continue
to flourish and develop, while others practically of the same age,
but slightly behind, quickly succumb, though the <i>feeding</i> roots
of both may draw upon the same soil layer. It is especially in sandy
soils that moisture is naturally thus conserved in the upper layers,
because of the failure of the water to rise by capillary ascent so as
to evaporate from the surface layer. It is often surprising to find a
good amount of moisture in the sandy soils of desert regions at the
depth of eight or ten inches, when the surface is so hot as to scorch
the fingers; and this moisture continues very uniformly to great
depths, probably to bottom water lying twenty or more feet below the
surface, which in such materials may readily be reached by taprooted
plants such as the “sagebrush” (Artemisia tridentata), the saltbushes
(Atriplex) and others.</p>

<p><i>Injurious Rise of Bottom Water resulting from Irrigation.</i>—In
the deep, pervious sandy lands of the arid region, especially where
the rainfall is very low and can wet the soil annually only to two
or three feet depth, the substrata are sometimes found to be barely
moist to depths of thirty and forty feet, and the short-lived spring
vegetation carries off during its growth all the moisture supplied
by the winter rains. When such lands are subjected to irrigation and
the ditches carrying the water are simply dug into the natural sandy
land, the thirsty soil absorbs the water greedily, so that even a
considerable volume of water makes but slow progress toward the farther
end of the canals. Gradually, as the rapidity of absorption decreases,
the diminution of flow becomes less sensible, but still the loss thus
experienced may be a very considerable percentage of the whole supply.
Thus in the Great Valley of California, as well as in portions of
Wyoming (Bull. 61, p. 32), the permanent loss from seepage is in the
case of some extensive irrigation systems estimated at fully 50 per
cent. When such lands have a considerable slope, the injury commonly
ends with the loss of the water, which in many cases is again gathered
and utilized at a lower level. But when the lands have but a slight
slope, the drainage may become so slow as to permit of the gradual rise
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
of the seepage water in the substrata, until finally it may come to
within a few feet of, or actually to the surface.</p>

<p><i>Consequences of the Swamping of Irrigated Lands.</i>—The injurious
consequences of this swamping of the irrigated lands may readily
be imagined. The first effect is usually noted in the sickening or
dying-out of orchards and vineyards, consequent upon the submergence
of the deeper roots, which in such lands frequently reach to from
fifteen to twenty feet below the surface. But even where pre-existing
plantations are not in question, the shallowing of the soil- and
subsoil-strata from which the plants may draw their nourishment,
constitutes a most serious injury to the cultural value of the land. It
has become unsuited to deep-rooted crops; and where the natural soil,
alone, would have perpetuated fertility for many years, fertilization
becomes necessary within a short time. The injury becomes doubly great
when, as is frequently the case, the rising bottom water brings up
with it to the surface soil the alkali salts which previously were
distributed throughout many feet of substrata, frequently rendering
profitable cultivation impossible where formerly the most luxuriant
crops were grown.</p>

<p>Theoretically of course it is perfectly easy to avoid or remedy these
troubles. It is only necessary to render the ditches water-tight by
puddling with clay, cement, or otherwise. But the heavy cost of this
improvement forms a serious obstacle to its adoption by the ditch
companies who are not themselves owners of land. Thus, extensive areas
of lands which when first irrigated were among the most productive,
have in the course of eight or ten years become almost valueless to
their owners, to whom legislation thus far affords but distant promise
of relief; although the case seems in equity to fall clearly within the
limits of the laws governing trespass.</p>

<p><i>Permanent Injury to Certain Lands.</i>—In cases like those alluded
to the remedy usually available for higher ground-water does not
always afford relief, even when otherwise available. Long-continued
submergence produces in many soils effects which cannot easily, if at
all, be overcome by subsequent aeration. This is most emphatically true
of soils containing a large proportion of ferric hydrate in the finely
divided form in which it is usually present in “red” soils.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span></p>

<p>The first effect of the stagnation of water in such lands (as
already explained in a former <a href="#Page_45">chapter 3, p. 45</a>) is to
set up a reductive (bacterial) fermentation of the organic matter of the soil,
transforming the ferric into ferrous hydrate, which in the presence of
the carbonic acid simultaneously formed, becomes ferrous carbonate,
readily soluble in carbonated water. That this compound is poisonous
to plant growth, has been stated (<a href="#Page_46">chap. 3, p. 46</a>). The
carbonates of lime and magnesia are simultaneously dissolved by the same, as is
also calcic phosphate, the usual form in which phosphoric acid is
present in the soil. Under the influence of partial aeration from
the surface, the ferrous carbonate is slowly re-transformed into
ferric hydrate, aggregated in the form of spots or concretions of
“bog ore” (<a href="#Page_66">see chapter 5, p. 66</a>). In this process the
greater part of the phosphoric acid of the soil is also abstracted from its general
mass and concentrated in the bog ore (<a href="#Page_65">chap. 5, p. 65</a>), in
which it is wholly unavailable to vegetation, and cannot be made available while
in the ground, by any known process. The soil is therefore permanently
impoverished in phosphoric acid; it is also deprived of its content of
ferric hydrate, and is transferred from the class of “red” to that of
“white” soils, well known everywhere to be unthrifty and to require
early fertilization. Not only is this true, because of their almost
invariable poverty in phosphoric acid, but also usually in lime, which
like the iron, if not leached out, is aggregated into concretions
in the subsoil, leaving the surface soil depleted of this important
ingredient. The humus, also, is either destroyed or at least “soured”
at the same time.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90"><i>Reduction of Sulfates.</i>—Should such
a soil contain any considerable amount of sulfates, especially in the
form of gypsum or calcic (or magnesic) sulfate, the reductive process
results in the formation of iron pyrite (<a href="#Page_75">ferric sulfid, chap. 5,
p. 75</a>); while at the same time the soil is often sufficiently impregnated
with sulfuretted hydrogen as to be readily perceived by the odor, or
by the blackening of a silver coin. This is very commonly the case in
sea-coast marshes, where a hole made with a stick thrust into the mud
will be found to give forth both carburetted and sulfuretted hydrogen,
while a careful washing of the soil will reveal the presence of minute
crystals of iron pyrite. Hence the need of prolonged aeration of marsh
soils, effecting the peroxidation of the ferrous compounds, and the
conversion of the pyrite first into ferrous sulfate, and subsequently
into innocuous, yellow, insoluble ferric oxy-sulfate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
<i>Ferruginous Lands.</i>—The injurious effect of the swamping of
ferruginous lands has been especially conspicuous in some of the
irrigated rolling lands of the Sierra Foothills of California, where
orchards planted in relatively low ground and in full bearing have
succumbed to the poisonous effects of the ferrous carbonate formed
in the subsoil, long before the water had risen so high that, had
the trees been grown afterwards, they would have adapted their
root system to the existing conditions and fared moderately well
at least. Underdrainage of the lower lands is, of course, the only
possible remedy for this state of things, although even then the
root-penetration is much more restricted, and therefore natural
fertility of much shorter duration, than would have been the case
without the rise of the irrigation water.</p>

<p>It is thus clear that in the practice of irrigation, the liability
of injury to the lower ground by “swamping” through the rise of the
ground water should always be kept in view; that, in fact, irrigation
and provision for drainage should always go hand in hand. The legal
provisions facilitating the rights-of-way for irrigation ditches should
be made equally cogent with respect to drainage.</p>

<span class="h_subtitle">WATER OF SOILS (<i>Continued</i>).</span></h3>
</div>

<p class="center">THE REGULATION AND CONSERVATION<br> OF SOIL MOISTURE.</p>

<p>In view of the commanding importance of an adequate supply of water to
vegetation, the possible and available means of assuring such supply
by utilizing to the best advantage both rainfall and irrigation water,
require the closest consideration.</p>

<p><i>Loosening of the Surface.</i>—The first thing needful, of course,
is to allow the water free opportunity to soak into the soil, so as to
moisten the land as deeply as possible. That to this end the surface
should be kept loose and pervious by tillage, breaking up crusts
that may have been formed by the beating of rains, has already been
discussed. In the case of heavy clay soils, however, this alone is not
always sufficient. The most effectual way to loosen the land to greater
depths than can be reached by tillage, is by means of underdrains laid
at the greatest depth that is practically admissible.</p>

<p><i>Effects of Underdrains.</i>—That drain tiles laid for the express
purpose of carrying off surplus water should help to conserve soil
moisture, seems at first sight to be a paradox. Yet the explanation
of the fact, which has been demonstrated by long experience, is not
difficult. The effect is most striking in clay soils, for sandy soils
are commonly naturally underdrained already.</p>

<p>In discussing the changes of volume which soils undergo in wetting
and drying, the fundamental points in the premises have already
been mentioned (<a href="#Page_112">see chap. 7, p. 112</a>). Clay soils in drying
shrink considerably, and re-expand on wetting, but rather slowly; moreover,
some clays crumble when wetted <i>after</i> drying, while others, very
plastic when wet, crumble on drying (<a href="#Page_116">see chap. 7, p. 116</a>).</p>

<p>It follows that while a clay subsoil when kept permanently wet, will
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
form a uniform, pasty, difficultly penetrable mass: when subjected
to frequent alternate wetting and drying, it becomes fissured and
crumbly, so as to resemble in its texture a tilled soil. This frequent
alternation of wetting and drying is precisely what, in the course of
time, is brought about by underdrains; rendering clay subsoils pervious
both to air and water. The consequence is that even heavy rains can be
fully absorbed by the soil mass lying above the drains, the surplus
draining off readily in a short time. Roots therefore can not only
penetrate, but exercise their vegetative functions perfectly at the
full depth of the drains. They are still at liberty to penetrate as
much deeper as their demands for moisture may require; but the depth
of four to four and a half feet is already so much greater than in the
humid region would usually be reached by them in undrained clay soils,
that commonly the moisture successively retained within that mass is
as much as is required by them during the growing season. At the same
time, their feeding roots are so far below the surface, that ordinary
short droughts do not reach them at all; while the underdrains prevent
any injurious stagnation of water around them. It need hardly be added
that the entire task of cultivation is also greatly facilitated; not
only because drained soils can be plowed within a few hours after the
cessation of rains, as against the same number of days that would have
to elapse in the undrained areas; but because tillage is easier, and
less draft is required, even when it is carried to a much greater depth.</p>

<p><i>Underdrainage</i>, then, must be counted as being among the most
effective means both of utilizing the rainfall so as to prevent loss
from runoff and injury from washing, and of creating a deep, loose,
pervious soil mass, well adapted to root penetration as well as to
the conservation of moisture; rendering possible timely tillage and
cultivation, and early development of crops fully supplied with
moisture and therefore secure against loss from drought. The safety
and improvement of crops thus secured corresponds in the humid region
to that brought about by the command of irrigation water in the arid
countries. But it by no means follows that underdrainage can therefore
be dispensed with in the latter, or irrigation in the former. Both
have their proper place in both regions; but from special causes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
underdrainage, as has already been stated, should be widely used in
irrigation countries to prevent the injuries otherwise but too likely
to arise from over-irrigation (<a href="#Page_231">see chap. 12, p. 231</a>).</p>

<p><i>Winter Irrigation.</i>—In many regions where irrigation is
desirable but not absolutely necessary in ordinary seasons, or where
irrigation water is scarce in summer, much advantage is gained by
insuring thorough saturation of the land during the latter part of
winter, especially when spring or summer crops are to be sown. The not
inconsiderable time required for water to reach its permanent level
or the country drainage in most soils, often insures the retention of
a certain surplus over what the soil can permanently hold, within the
period when it can be utilized by growing crops; whose roots moreover
are more likely to penetrate deeply in land where there is a steady
increase of moisture as they descend, than when the contrary condition
is encountered. The use of <i>winter flood-waters to saturate the
land</i> is therefore in many cases the saving clause for a dry season.</p>

<h4>METHODS OF IRRIGATION.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></h4>

<p>The manner in which irrigation water is supplied to land
and especially to growing crops exerts such a potent influence
not only upon the welfare of the plants but also upon the condition
of the land, that a brief discussion of this topic seems necessary.</p>

<p>The following methods are in use to a greater or less extent:</p>

<ul class="index">
<li class="isub2">1. Surface sprinkling.</li>
<li class="isub2">2. Flooding.</li>
<li class="isub5">A. By lateral overflow from furrows or ditches.</li>
<li class="isub5">B. By the “check” system.</li>
<li class="isub2">3. Furrow irrigation.</li>
<li class="isub2">4. Lateral seepage from ditches.</li>
<li class="isub2">5. Basin irrigation.</li>
<li class="isub2">6. Irrigation from underground pipes.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
<i>Surface Sprinkling.</i>—This method seems to be the closest
imitation of the natural rainfall; and yet it is in practice about
the most wasteful and least satisfactory of all. It is difficult of
application on any large scale, from obvious causes; on the small
scale, in gardens and on lawns, its disadvantages become amply
apparent. As usually practiced, from a rose spout or spray nozzle, the
water falls much more abundantly than in the case of any desirable
rain, within the short time allowed by the patience of the operator.
If continued for a sufficient length of time to soak the soil to the
desirable depth, it compacts the surface of the ground so as to render
subsequent tillage indispensable. To avoid this, amateur gardeners
usually restrict the time of application, repeating the same at
frequent intervals, sometimes daily. The result is that the very slight
penetration of the water either fails to reach the absorbent roots, so
that it is of little use to them, and is evaporated by the next day’s
sun or wind; or else it tends to draw the roots close to the surface,
where, unless the application of water is actually made daily, they
are sure to suffer from the first intermission of the daily dose. In
actual practice the sprinkling method is therefore both inefficient
and wasteful of water, and exposes the plants to grave injury from any
cessation of the water supply.</p>

<p>Flooding presupposes land either level or only slightly sloping
naturally, or rendered so artificially; usually by means of the plow
and horse scraper.</p>

<p><i>Flooding</i> by lateral overflow from large furrows, or ditches,
is very commonly practiced where the water supply is abundant and
large areas, such as alfalfa or grain fields, are to be irrigated. The
overflow is regulated by portable check-boards, proceeding from the
highest points to the lowest, and leaving each temporary dike in place
until the ground is adequately soaked or the water reaches the next
furrow below. In heavy ground the operation may have to be repeated to
insure proper depth of percolation.</p>

<p><i>Check flooding</i> necessitates more careful leveling, and the
throwing up of small dikes, either temporary or permanent. The
costliness of the earth-work restricts the use of this method
materially, and the inconvenience caused in tillage by the dikes is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
objectionable, especially in large-scale culture. For the case of
alfalfa fields, which remain permanently set for a number of years, it
is however the largely preferred method. In the case of field cultures,
the consolidation of the surface that follows flooding on the heavier
soils renders subsequent tillage necessary in all but very sandy soils;
and hence it should always <i>precede</i> broadcast sowing.</p>

<p>One disadvantage of the surface flooding system is the slow penetration
of the water caused by the resistance of the air in the soil to
downward displacement; its buoyancy acting directly contrary to the
percolation of the water. In close-grained, heavy soils this objection
is very serious, on account of the loss of time involved when the
irrigator’s time is limited. On sandy lands the air bubbles up quite
livelily at first, but this soon ceases and the air is compelled to
escape sideways as best it can.</p>

<p><i>Furrow Irrigation.</i>—By this method it is intended to soak the
land uniformly by allowing the water to flow through furrows drawn 3
to 8 feet apart, with a gentle slope from the supply or head ditch;
the flow being continued until the water has reached the far end of
the furrows, or longer according to the nature of the soil, especially
if another ditch to receive the surplus flow lies below. The furrows
should subsequently be closed by means of the plow or cultivator; but
even if left open they are much less a source of waste by evaporation
than would be a flooded surface. The water thus, in the main, soaks
downward and only reaches the surface by capillary rise, so that the
land between the furrows is not sensibly compacted when the furrows
have been made deep enough. Evidently this is a much more rational
procedure than surface flooding, as it tends to leave most of the
surface in loose tilth, while penetrating to much greater advantage,
because of the ready escape of the air from the soil. It is the system
naturally and almost exclusively used in truck gardens and orchards,
and generally where crops are grown in drills or rows sufficiently far
apart to permit of cultivation.

              penetration in Furrow Irrigation.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
The figure annexed<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>
shows the manner in which water sinks and spreads from furrows of
various depths and widths, as actually observed in the work of the
Irrigation Division of the U. S. Dep’t of Agriculture, under the direct
supervision of Prof. R. H. Loughridge of the California Station. The
mode of percolation is shown for two soils, a heavy loam and a sandy
one, both in the vicinity of Riverside, Cal.</p>

<p>The upper section shows the variation in penetration in one and the
same soil with the same kind of furrow, the broken line indicating the
cessation of the flow in the furrows; after which there was a still
farther penetration of the water to from 6 to 9 inches deeper.</p>

<p>The second section from above shows the percolation of the water
respectively in wide and narrow furrows of the same depth. It is
evident at a glance how much more effective is the wide furrow in
utilizing the limited time during which the irrigator usually has the
flow at his command.</p>

<p>The third section shows several practically important points in favor
of the wide and deep instead of narrow and shallow furrow. It is seen
that in doubling the width and depth, the penetration has also nearly
doubled. Moreover, it is seen that in the deep furrow the water has not
in the course of seven hours reached the surface at all, being still
six inches away; so that in view of the diminishing ratio of capillary
ascent, it probably would not have reached the edge of the furrow, at
the surface, in less than thirty hours. Thus all surface evaporation,
which oftentimes causes the loss of 50 % of the water entering the
shallow furrows, would be prevented; and a dry furrow-slice might
be turned into the furrow immediately after the cessation of the
water-flow, effectually obviating the need of subsequent tillage
also. The cost of the latter, together with the saving in water, and
increased efficiency of the water by deeper penetration, will much more
than offset the additional cost and trouble of plowing deeper furrows.</p>

<p>There is therefore every reason for doing away with the wasteful,
easy-going practice of irrigating in numerous shallow furrows, by which
the irrigator loses up to half of the water paid for, by evaporation;
is compelled to wait for the soaked surface to dry before being able to
turn back a furrow-slice into the furrows to prevent the drying-out of
their moisture; and by losing penetration of the water, is obliged to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
irrigate again within a much shorter time than will be necessary if
deep-furrow irrigation be used.</p>

<p>A similar experiment with deep and shallow furrows was made at the
Southern California station near Pomona in 1901, as reported in
Bulletin 138 of the California Station. The results as far as they
went were precisely similar, and upon the basis of these the writer
earnestly advocated deep-furrow irrigation, and had the satisfaction
of seeing it strongly approved by orange-growers at Riverside and
elsewhere, by putting it into practice.</p>

<p>In addition to the saving and better utilization of the water used,
this mode of application has the advantage of preventing the roots from
coming too near the surface; it will also largely eliminate “irrigation
hardpan” or plowsole.</p>

<p>The results produced by long-continued shallow plowing and irrigation
in shallow furrows is well illustrated in the last of the irrigation
profiles, which shows the observations made on the same land as the
others, but where rational cultivation and deep-furrow irrigation
had not yet been introduced. It will be seen that after applying,
and of course paying for, the water for three days, its average
penetration was only about eighteen inches; so that the trees of the
orchard received very little benefit, and were supposed to be needing
fertilization when in fact they were simply suffering from lack of
water at the lower roots.</p>

<p>One somewhat unexpected point is shown by these diagrams, viz., the
slight sidewise penetration of the water; the wetted areas having a
nearly vertical lateral outline. This means, of course, that unless the
furrows run very near the trees of an orchard, the soil immediately
beneath the trees will remain dry; thus inducing the roots to spread
sideways and losing depth of penetration and soil. It will be noted
especially in the lower figure that here again the deep furrow offers
a material advantage over the shallow, the sidewise spread being much
more pronounced than in the shallow furrow alongside.</p>

<p><i>Distance Between Furrows and Ditches.</i>—The distance between the
furrows must, of course, be proportioned to the readiness with which
the water penetrates, being less as the land is of closer texture. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
distance between head ditches must, on the contrary, vary in the
opposite sense, since if these are too far apart, the water near
the head ditch will in sandy lands be wasting into the subdrainage
before the end of the furrows is reached; so that the distribution
will be very uneven. The great differences observed between crops,
and especially trees, <i>below</i> and <i>above</i> the head ditches,
are mainly due to this unevenness in water distribution, caused by
too great distance between successive head ditches. Each farmer must
himself, however, determine by actual trial the proper distances
between ditches as well as furrows, for his particular case; since
everything depends upon the rapidity with which water will penetrate
the soil and subsoil. Actual tests to determine this point<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>
should be the first step, before laying off the system of ditches as well
as furrows. It not uncommonly happens that the failure to do this
at first, compels a subsequent total change of arrangements in this
respect. (See page 253 below).</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">Thus while in some very pervious land
furrows may be six or even eight feet apart, in other cases, in certain
finely pulverulent or silty soils such as the “dust soils” described
in a former chapter; (<a href="#Page_104">see chapter 6, p. 104</a>), furrows drawn
three feet apart may fail to allow the water to penetrate so as to prevent grain
on the middle foot from suffering from drought after the water has run
for twenty-four hours.</p>

<p><i>Irrigation by lateral Seepage.</i>—Is in reality a mere
modification of furrow irrigation, practiced in the case of lands very
readily permeable, and where water is abundant. The fields are laid
off in “lands” twelve to twenty-five feet wide, with a deep furrow or
narrow ditch between, from which water percolates in a short time so as
to overlap from the two sides. In this case sometimes the water does
not reach the surface visibly at all; a very great advantage where
alkali exists, as surface evaporation, and the consequent accumulation
of alkali, is thus effectually prevented; while deep-rooting is favored
to the utmost.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span></p>

<p><i>Basin Irrigation.</i>—In this method of irrigation, practiced only
in the case of trees and sometimes vines, and when water is scarce, a
wide circular furrow or basin is excavated around each trunk and water
is run either from one to the other, or sideways from a furrow laid
along the rows. The water thus applied of course percolates immediately
around the trunk first, and in practice is found to follow also the
large roots; so that it goes precisely where it is most wanted, besides
forming a vertical body of moist soil reaching to considerable depth,
where it is most desirable that the root system should follow. By
this deep penetration to natural moisture in the depths of the soil,
comparatively small quantities of water produce very marked effects.</p>

<p>On the same principle, the grape vines which bear some of the choicest
raisins of Malaga on the arid coastward slopes, are made to supply
themselves with moisture, without irrigation, by opening around them
large, funnel-shaped pits, which remain open in winter so as to catch
the rain, causing it to penetrate downward along the taproot of the
vine, in clay shale quite similar to that of the California Coast
Ranges, and like the latter almost vertically on edge. Yet on these
same slopes scarcely any natural vegetation now finds a foothold.</p>

<p>Similarly the “ryats” of parts of India water their crops by applying
to each plant immediately around the stem such scanty measure of the
precious fluid as they have taken from wells, often of considerable
depth, which form their only source of water-supply. Perhaps in
imitation of these, an industrious farmer has practiced a similar
system on the high benches of Kern River, California, and has
successfully grown excellent fruit for years, on land that would
originally grow nothing but cactus. Sub-irrigation from pipes has been
applied in a similar manner.</p>

<p>A combination of the furrow- and basin-irrigation system is sometimes
practiced in southern California by drawing the furrow so as to bring
the tree within a square, one side of which is left closed. The same
result may be accomplished by plowing cross furrows at right angles
near the tree and then placing check-boards so as to force the water
along the rows, zigzagging, on three sides.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span></p>

<p>The basin irrigation of orchards was originally largely practiced in
California, but has now been mostly abandoned for furrow irrigation.
The latter has been adopted partly because it requires a great deal
less hand-labor, partly under the impression that the whole of the soil
of the orchard is thus most thoroughly utilized; partly also because of
the injurious effect upon trees produced at times by basin irrigation.</p>

<p>The explanation of such injurious effects is, essentially, that
<i>cold</i> irrigation water depresses too much the temperature of the
earth immediately around the roots, and thus hinders active vegetation
to an injurious extent, sometimes so as to bring about the dropping
of the fruit. This of course is a very serious objection, to obviate
which it might be necessary to reservoir the water so as to allow it
to warm before being applied to the trees.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>
In furrow-irrigation the amount of soil soaked with the water is so
great that the latter is soon effectually warmed up, besides not coming
in contact too intimately with the main roots of the tree; along which
the water soaks very readily when applied to the trunk, thus affecting
their temperature much more directly. It is for the farmer to determine
which consideration should prevail in a given case. If the water-supply
be scant and warm, the most effectual use that can be made of it is to
apply it immediately around the tree, in a circular trench dug for the
purpose. When on the contrary, irrigation water is abundant and its
temperature low, it may be preferable to practice furrow irrigation, or
possibly even flooding.</p>

<p>As to the supposed more complete use of the soil under the latter
two methods, it must be remembered that while this is the case in a
<i>horizontal</i> direction, if irrigation is practiced too copiously
under the shallow-furrow system, it may easily happen that the gain
made horizontally is more than offset by a corresponding loss in the
<i>vertical</i> penetration of the root-system. This is amply apparent
in some of the irrigated orange groves of southern California, where
the fine roots of the trees fill the surface soil as do the roots of
maize in a corn field of the Mississippi States; so that the plow can
hardly be run without turning them up and under. In these same orchards
it will often be observed, in digging down, that at a depth of a few
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
feet the soil is too water-soaked to permit of the proper exercise
of the root-functions, and that the roots existing there are either
inactive or diseased. That in such cases frequent irrigation and
abundant fertilization alone can maintain an orchard in bearing
condition, is a matter of course; and there can be no question that
a great deal of the constant cry for the fertilization of orchards
in the irrigated sections is due quite as much to the shallowness
of rooting induced by over-irrigation, as to any really necessary
exhaustion of the land. When the roots are induced to come to and
remain at the surface, within a surface layer of eighteen to twenty
inches, it naturally becomes necessary to feed these roots abundantly,
both with moisture and with plant-food. This has, as naturally, led to
an overestimate of the requirements of the trees in both respects. Had
deep-rooting been encouraged at first in the deep soils of the southern
“citrus belt,” instead of over-stimulating the growth by surface
fertilization and frequent irrigation, some delay in bearing would have
been compensated for by less of current outlay for fertilizers, and
less liability to injury from frequently unavoidable delay, or from
inadequacy, of irrigation.</p>

<p><i>Irrigation by Underground Pipes.</i>—Where economy in the use of
irrigation water is a pressing requirement, its distribution through
underground pipes affords the surest mode of accomplishing that end,
in connection with the application of the water in accordance with the
principles just discussed. The enormous saving of water effected by
its conveyance in cement-lined ditches or concrete pipes, as compared
with earth ditches, if additionally combined with its application to
individual trees or vines, presents the maximum of economy that can
be effected. The actual use of this method is unfortunately limited
in practice by the high first cost of piping; but as its use renders
unnecessary the digging of basins and plowing of furrows and their
subsequent closing-up, it is when once established by far the cheapest
system, both as to the use of water and of labor.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">The best results of this system are
undoubtedly achieved by the use of iron pipes for the distribution
in field and orchard, whatever may be the material used for the main
conduits. The use of concrete and tile in small sizes proves in the end
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
very expensive, because of frequent breakage, and leakage due to
varying pressure in the supply pipes or reservoirs; as well as from
even slight earthquake tremors, undermining by water or by the
burrowing of animals, and many other accidents which do not affect an
iron pipe system. The pipes must in any case, of course, be laid deep
enough to be out of reach of the deepest tillage; therefore not less
than one foot, and preferably eighteen inches. A proper construction
of the outlets, permitting of exact regulation of the flow and ready
operation from above ground, as well as preventing their being clogged
by earth, rust, roots or burrowing animals, insects etc., is of course
of the greatest importance. A variety of devices for this purpose is
already on the market.</p>

<h4>QUALITY OF THE IRRIGATION WATER.</h4>

<p><i>Saline Waters.</i>—Considering the large amount of water
annually used in irrigation, among the most needful precautions to
be observed by the irrigator is in the testing of the quality of his
water-supply. First among the points to be noted is the possible
content of soluble “alkali” salts. While in most cases what is called
the “rise of the alkali” is due to the salts already contained in the
soil and subsoil, in but too many the evil is either brought about,
or greatly aggravated, by the excessive saline contents of the water
used in irrigation. The effects of the use of saline irrigation water
(containing in this case about 100 grains per gallon, or 1700 parts
per million) are shown in the accompanying plate. The predominant
ingredients of these alkali salts were common salt and carbonate of
soda. In the lands near Corona, Cal., where this case was observed, the
original alkali-content of the soil was about 2500 pounds per acre in
four feet depth, and had been just quadrupled, with the results shown;
viz., complete defoliation of the orange trees, while on the same
land, where the trees had been irrigated with good artesian water, the
orchard was in fine condition.</p>

<p><i>Limits of Salinity.</i>—It is not easy to assign a definite limit
of mineral content beyond which water should be considered unfit for
irrigation purposes; partly because of the differences in the kind of
the mineral salts, partly because the nature of the soil and the amount
of water at command, materially influence its availability.

as well as irrigation waters. But if most or the whole of such mineral
contents should consist of the carbonates and sulfates of lime and
magnesia, the water while unsuitable for domestic use may be perfectly
available for irrigation, since these salts are either beneficial or
harmless in the amounts likely to be introduced by the water. But if
most or the whole of such forty grains should consist of “alkali salts”
proper, viz., the sulfates, chlorids and carbonates of potash and soda,
or if they should contain even small amounts of the chlorid of
magnesium, they might render the water either wholly unsuitable for
irrigation, or if used it would be needful to take the mineral content
into consideration, by regulating its application accordingly.</p>

<p>It has been found in California that practically the upper limit of
mineral content for irrigation water <i>under the ordinary practice</i>
lies below seventy grains per gallon in <i>all</i> cases; for when
this strength is reached, even though such water may bathe the roots
of almost any plant with impunity, yet accidental concentration
by evaporation is so certain to happen, that injury to crops is
practically almost unavoidable.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">In South Dakota and other parts of the
American semi-arid region, waters containing seventy grains and even
more of alkali salts per gallon are annually used during the short
irrigation season. This can be done harmlessly because the aggregate
amount used is only small, and the more abundant rainfall of that
region annually washes the salts out of the soil. But where almost the
full amount of water required by crops must be supplied by irrigation,
the total amount of salts thus introduced would speedily render the
land uncultivable.</p>

<p>According to the observations of Means and other explorers<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
of the U. S. Dep’t of Agriculture, waters of much higher mineral content
are used for irrigation both in Egypt and in the Saharan region, some
going as high as 8000 parts per million, or 214 grains per gallon. The
cultivators are said to be very skilful in the use of these waters,
applying them only to plants of known resistance, and in certain ways.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
These ways include doubtless a good deal more time and patience than
American irrigators are ordinarily willing to bestow upon their work.
Much depends of course not only upon the character of the salts in the
water, but also upon the long experience had in the old irrigation regions.</p>

<p><i>Mode of using Saline Irrigation Waters.</i>—The fact that abundant
growths of native as well as cultivated plants may sometimes be seen on
the margins of “alkali lakes” where water of over a hundred grains of
mineral salts per gallon continuously bathes the roots, while the same
plants perish at some distance from the water’s edge, points the way to
the utilization, in emergencies, of fairly strong saline waters; viz.,
by the prevention of their concentration to the point of injury <i>by
evaporation</i>. It is clear that when such waters are used sparingly,
so as to penetrate but a few feet underground, whence the moisture
re-ascends for evaporation at the surface, a few repetitions of its
use will accumulate so much alkali near the surface as to bring about
serious injury. If, on the other hand, the water is used so abundantly
that the roots may be considered as being, like the marginal vegetation
of alkali lakes, bathed only by water of moderate strength, no such
injury need occur; and what does accumulate in consequence of the
inevitable measure of evaporation occurring in the course of a season,
may be washed out of the land by <i>copious winter irrigation</i>.</p>

<p>This, of course, presupposes that the land, as is mostly the case in
the arid region, is readily drained downwards when a sufficiency of
water is used. When this is not the case, <i>e. g.</i>, in clay or
adobe soils, or in those underlaid by hardpan, waters which in sandy
lands could have been used with impunity, may become inapplicable to
irrigation use.</p>

<p><i>Apparent Paradox.</i>—The prescription to use saline waters <i>more
abundantly</i> than purer ones, in order to avoid injury from alkali,
though paradoxical at first sight, is therefore plainly justified by
common sense as well as by experience, in pervious (sandy) soils;
while in difficultly permeable ones, their use may be either wholly
impracticable, or subject to very close limitation.</p>

<p>Sometimes the alternate use of pure and salt-charged water serves to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
eke out a too scant supply of the former. But in all such cases, close
attention to the <i>measure</i> of water that will wet the soil to a
certain depth, and “eternal vigilance” with respect to the accumulation
of alkali near the surface, must be the price of immunity from injury.
In all cases the farmer should know how much of alkali salts he
introduces into his land with the irrigation water, and watch that it
does not approach too closely, or exceed, the tolerance of his crops
for alkali salts, as given in <a href="#Page_83">chapter 26</a>.</p>

<p><i>Use of Drainage Waters for Irrigation.</i>—When lands charged with
alkali salts are being reclaimed by drainage, the question sometimes
arises whether the drainage-water may not be used for irrigation,
lower down. This of course depends entirely upon the amount of alkali
in the water, the nature of the lands to be irrigated, and the manner
of applying it. In the Fresno drainage-district of California it has
been shown that some of the drainage-water contains not more than 25 to
30 grains per gallon of objectionable salts, and such waters could of
course be used on pervious lands with the precautions above noted.</p>

<p><i>“Black Alkali” Waters.</i>—As regards, however, waters containing
any large proportion of carbonate of soda, it must be remembered that
even very dilute solutions of salsoda serve to puddle the soil and
thus render it difficultly tillable. When such waters are used it
is necessary to forestall injury either by the use of gypsum in the
reservoir or ditch, or by annually using on the land a sufficient
amount of gypsum to transform the carbonate of soda into the relatively
innocuous sulfate.</p>

<p><i>Variations in the Saline Contents of Irrigation Waters.</i>—When
irrigation waters are derived from deep wells, there is little if
any variation of their saline contents to be expected, and a single
analysis will serve permanently. But in the case of relatively
shallow wells, from which the water must be raised by pumping, it not
unfrequently happens that after a series of seasons of short rainfall,
saline waters are brought up by the pump and may seriously injure
crops and orchards. Again, in the case of streams and rivers whose
flow becomes very small in summer, the saline content may increase to
several times the amount carried at the time of high water. Both kinds
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
of cases occur in southern California, in Arizona,<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>
New Mexico and other states of the arid region. The Gila, Pecos and
upper Rio Grande are cases in point, and to a certain extent the
Colorado of the West.</p>

<p><i>Muddy Waters.</i>—In the latter as well as other streams of
Arizona, there is another point which sometimes creates difficulties
to the irrigator, together with some current expense. It is the amount
of silt or mud carried by the water, which while it is a benefit to
the land over which it is spread, (“warping”) as in the classic case
of the Nile, often clogs the irrigation ditches to such an extent as
to cause considerable inconvenience and expense in cleaning them out.
This is especially the case in the streams draining pasture lands that
have been overstocked, and where the destruction of the natural herbage
allows the rain water to run off rapidly, at first forming runlets and
then gullies and ravines that originally were simply cow-paths leading
toward the watering places.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>
The devastation of lands thus caused in Arizona is almost as great as
that which has occurred in the Cotton states, as mentioned above
<a href="#Page_217">chap. 12. p. 217</a>.</p>

<p>These variations in the character of the irrigation water must of
course be watched by the farmer who does not receive directly from
mountain streams, or from deep artesian wells water known to have a
constant content of saline matter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The duty of irrigation water.</span>—The amount
of water thought to be needed for the production of satisfactory crops
varies widely in different regions, ranging all the way from about two
feet to as much as eight annually, within the United States; while in
the sugar-cane fields of the Hawaiian Islands as much as three inches
per week, or over twelve acre-feet in the course of the year, have been
thought to be beneficial, if not absolutely required for the best crop results.</p>

<p>As has been stated above (<a href="#Page_215">chap. 12, p. 215</a>), the rainfall
limit below which irrigation becomes, if not absolutely essential, at least a
highly desirable condition for the safety of crops, is usually assumed
to lie at about 20 inches (500 milimeters). This general statement
is, however, subject to material modification according to the manner
in which the rainfall is distributed. Thus in central Montana with
24 inches of rainfall distributed throughout the year, irrigation is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
indispensable; while in the Santa Clara valley of central California,
with an average rainfall of 15 inches falling through the winter and
spring, the growth of all ordinary field crops has for fifty years
not failed oftener than is commonly the case in the humid region of
the North Central states. This is because in California the winter
and spring are the growing seasons, while the rainless summers do not
stand in the way, for crops are already harvested; and the deep rooting
of trees and vines provides these with the needful moisture from the
depths of the substrata (<a href="#Page_163">see chap. 10, pp. 163 to 173</a>).</p>

<p>It would thus seem that twenty inches of irrigation water properly
applied ought to be sufficient for all purposes, when added to the
natural rainfall, which is rarely entirely absent. Yet in actual
practice less than 24 acre-inches is rarely used, and much more is
the rule; 72 to 96 ins. being sometimes used in Arizona. Evidently
enormous losses occur in practice, and it is of the utmost importance
to discover the causes of these.</p>

<p><i>Causes of Loss.</i>—Since irrigation water is commonly measured
at the distributing weirs, loss from seepage and evaporation on the
way to the fields is an obvious source of an overestimate of the
water actually supplied to the farmer. In sandy districts the loss
thus incurred is reliably estimated at nearly 50% in many cases. The
apparent duty of the water is thus at once reduced to half its effect,
and four instead of two feet of water are supposed to have been used,
and are charged for.</p>

<p><i>Evaporation</i> resulting from surface flooding or use in shallow
furrows may, again, cause the loss of from 30 to 50% of the water that
actually reaches the land; so that in the latter case, between seepage
and evaporation the irrigator may lose the effect of three-fourths of
the water he pays for.</p>

<p><i>Loss by Percolation.</i>—Finally, the water may be wasted on the
land itself in leachy soils by over-use, <i>i. e.</i>, it may percolate
to a large extent beyond the reach of the roots when the flow is
continued too long; as will always be the case when the head (supply)
ditches are laid too far apart, so that the water may be wasting into
the country drainage just below the upper ditch long before the water
in the furrow reaches the lower one; as illustrated in the upper one of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
the subjoined diagrams. That this will not happen when the head ditches
are nearer together, is shown in the lower diagram.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img id="FIG_46-47" src="images/image253.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="299" >
    <p class="f90"><span class="smcap">Figs. 46, 47.</span>—Diagram showing loss
          by percolation when head ditches are too far apart.</p>
</div>

<p>The means of avoiding the mechanical losses have already been
discussed, and may be summarized thus: tightening of leaky ditches; use
of water in deep furrows; and ascertaining the rapidity of percolation
(<a href="#Page_242">see p. 242</a>) so as to obtain a proper gauge for the
time during which water should run, and for the distances at which head ditches
or furrows should be placed.</p>

<p>The importance of thus diminishing the losses of water is obvious when
it is considered that if the duty of water can be reduced to twenty
instead of forty or fifty acre-inches, twice the area can be irrigated
with the same amount of water, or the cost of water correspondingly
reduced. It should be noted that when the land is leachy it may be pure
waste to continue the flow beyond a few hours; but the irrigation must
then be more frequently repeated.</p>

<h4>EVAPORATION.</h4>

<p>Alongside of and supplementary to the best possible utilization of
the rainfall and irrigation water, the prevention of unnecessary
evaporation has to be considered. Evaporation from the soil’s surface
implies not only unnecessary loss of water that should have remained
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
for the use of the crop, but also the depression of temperature which,
as a rule, is unfavorable to the best development of vegetation. It
is only in case of extreme stress from hot, drying wind that such
evaporation and the consequent depression of the temperature of the
surface soil can be of advantage to the farmer.</p>

<p>The amount of water evaporating either from a water-surface, or from a
wet or moist soil, varies greatly according to the climatic conditions,
and the state of the weather; also according to the condition of the
soil-surface. There are damp climates, and days or periods when,
the air being nearly saturated with moisture, evaporation even from
a water-surface will be almost insensible. On the other hand, with
dry air and a high temperature, enormous quantities of water may be
evaporated in the course of a day. The evaporation from water-surfaces
interests deeply those who supply, as well as those who are supplied
with, water from storage reservoirs; evaporation from the soil-surface
interests deeply all farmers, and more especially irrigators whose
water-supply is scanty, or is paid for by them by measurement. Light
rains, as well as light surface irrigations, may at times evaporate
almost wholly without any effect save a lowering of the temperature of
the soil. In the case of snow, it is a well-known fact in the northern
arid regions that a light snowfall may in winter evaporate entirely
without imparting any liquid moisture to the soil. A loss of 50% of the
water actually brought upon land by surface irrigation is of common
occurrence in some portions of the irrigated region.</p>

<p>The dependence of evaporation upon air-temperature under conditions
otherwise identical, is well illustrated by the experiments made in
1904 by S. Fortier<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>
on the Experiment Station grounds at Berkeley, California, at a time
when under the influence of the sea breeze the average saturation of
the air might be assumed at about 70%. The tests were conducted in six
tanks sunk into the ground so as to place the water-surfaces on a level
with it, and the water-temperatures were maintained in four of the
tanks by means of ice or heating lamps. The results are shown in the
following table:

<p>Of these three stations, Pomona is located within reach of the ocean
winds, but distant 25 to 30 miles from the shore. Tulare is situated
in the upper San Joaquin valley, far in the interior; Calexico is in
the southern part of the Colorado desert, with extremes of temperature
ranging from 13° Fahr. in winter to 120° in summer.</p>

<p><i>Evaporation in Different Climates.</i>—The following table conveys
some general data regarding average evaporation from water-surfaces in
different climates. Evaporation from the soil-surface depends largely,
of course, upon the mechanical condition of the surface, the extent to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
which it is wetted, and the rapidity with which moisture will be
supplied from the subsoil as the surface dries. A field plowed into
rough furrows will evaporate more water than when harrowed, because of
the larger surface exposed; and a harrowed field moderately compacted
by rolling will lose less water by evaporation than when unrolled,
other things being equal. On the other hand, a thoroughly compacted
surface, even if suffering less loss at first than a plowed or harrowed
field, will continue to lose moisture longer by withdrawing it from the
substrata by its superior capillary suction; while a loose surface,
once dried out, will prevent farther loss from the subsoil very
effectually, as stated below.</p>

<p>This table, the data for which are taken from various sources,
exhibits clearly the enormous variations in evaporation in different
countries, and even in localities not very remote from each other. The
low evaporation near London is doubtless due to its foggy and hazy
atmosphere, but it is not clear why Rothamsted should show so low an
evaporation compared with Oxford. Tropical Demerara stands nearest to
Oxford in its evaporation; Bombay indicates its location on the hot and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
arid west coast of India, despite its nearness to the sea. The inland
localities in the desert regions of South Africa, Australia and Western
Turkestan, show how enormous may be the losses from evaporation of
irrigation water, unless the latter is applied with special care
for their prevention. Thus, with the wasteful methods of irrigation
prevailing in portions of the American arid region, it is certain that
in many cases 50% and more of the water evaporates before it reaches
the crops.</p>

<p><i>Evaporation from Reservoirs and Ditches.</i>—The evaporation from
water-surfaces especially may, in many cases, exceed the rainfall of
the year, so as to materially diminish the available water-supply
in reservoirs. Thus the annual evaporation from the reservoir-lakes
forming part of the water-supply of the city of San Francisco, ranges
from 40 to 50 inches, while the rainfall averages less than 24 inches.
Were it not, then, for the prevention of evaporation by a covering
of dry earth during summer, no moisture would remain in the ground
to sustain vegetation. In the cool coast climate of Berkeley, Cal.,
directly opposite the Golden Gate and subject to its summer fogs,
evaporation from a water-surface maintaining the average climatic
temperature of 60°, was found to be ¾ inch during the month from
the middle of July to the middle of August, 1904. But at the high
temperatures and low degree of air-saturation prevailing in the great
interior valley, or in the Colorado desert, the evaporation from
water-surfaces is enormously increased, exceeding even the figure given
in the table for Bombay. Hence the great importance of preventing all
avoidable evaporation, particularly in the use of irrigation water.</p>

<p><i>Prevention of Evaporation; Protective Surface Layer.</i>—The loose
tilth of the surface which is so conducive to the rapid absorption of
surface-water, is also, broadly speaking, the best means of reducing
evaporation to the lowest possible point. For while it is true that the
floccules of well-tilled soil permit of the ready access of air, and
therefore of evaporation, it is also true that these relatively coarse
compound particles are incapable of withdrawing capillary moisture from
the denser soil or subsoil underneath; just as a dry sponge is incapable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
of absorbing any moisture from a wet brick, while a dry brick will
readily withdraw nearly all the water contained in the relatively large
pores of the sponge (<a href="#Page_188">see chap. 11</a>). A layer of loose, dry
surface-soil is therefore an excellent preventive of evaporation of the moisture
from soils, and may be regarded as the natural and most available means
to be used by the farmer, both for the prevention of evaporation and to
moderate the access of excessive heat and dryness to the active roots.</p>

<p>As regards the desirable thickness of this protective layer of tilled
surface-soil, it should be kept in mind that in the humid region, where
rain can be expected at intervals of from one to three weeks, the
feeding roots may usually be found within a few inches of the surface;
while in the arid region, where irrigation is practiced at long
intervals or sometimes not at all, so that no water enters the soil
oftener than from two to six months, the roots necessarily vegetate at
lower depths, and hence the protective surface-layer can, and should
be, of greater thickness, to prevent the penetration of excessive heat
and dryness during the long interval.</p>

<p>The failure to appreciate this necessary difference often leads to
heavy losses on the part of newcomers to the arid region, who in this
as in other respects are apt to follow blindly the precepts familiar to
them in the East, until taught better by sore experience. In the East
and Middle West a depth of three inches is considered the proper one
for the protective surface-layer; and in the case of maize even this
is considered excessive in many cases. In the arid region this depth
should be at least doubled where irrigation is not practiced at least
every four to six weeks; and in some sandy soils even seven and eight
inches is not too much for effective protection.</p>

<p><i>Illustrations of Effects of Surface Tillage.</i>—The efficacy of
loose surface tilth in preventing evaporation, as compared with mere
superficial scratching or with the total omission of cultivation,
is well exemplified in a series of investigations conducted on this
subject during the extremely dry season of 1898, by the California
Experiment Station; the seasonal rainfall having during that year been
on an average from one-third to one-half only of the usual amount, so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
as to test to the utmost the endurance of all growing plants. Some
of the details of this investigation have been given above (<a href="#Page_214">p. 214</a>)
in connection with the question of moisture requirements of crops.
Loughridge<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>
also investigated the moisture conditions in adjacent orchards
differently treated in cultivation. In one of these cases two orchards
of apricots were separated only by a lane, and the soil identical; but
one owner had omitted cultivation, while the other had cultivated to an
extra depth in view of the dry season apparently impending. The results
are best shown by the plates below, showing representative trees and
the annual growth made by each. The table annexed shows the differences
in the moisture-content of the two fields to the depth of six feet, in July:</p>

<p>The difference of 244 tons per acre of ground shown by the analyses
is quite sufficient to account for the observed difference in the
cultural result. The cause of this difference was that in the
<i>uncultivated</i> field there was a compacted surface-layer of
several inches in thickness, which forcibly abstracted the moisture
from the substrata and evaporated it from its surface; while the loose
surface soil on the <i>cultivated</i> ground was unable to take any
moisture from the denser subsoil.

The cultural results were that on the cultivated ground the trees made
about three feet of annual growth, and the fruit was of good, normal
size; while the trees in the uncultivated ground made barely three
inches of growth, and the fruit was stunted and wholly unsaleable. It
may be added that when, instructed by the season’s experience, the
owner of the “uncultivated” orchard cultivated deeply the following
season, his trees showed as good growth and fruit as his neighbor’s.</p>

<h4>EVAPORATION THROUGH THE ROOTS<br> AND LEAVES OF PLANTS.</h4>

<p>Undesirable as is the evaporation from the surface of the soil, under
all but exceptional conditions the evaporation from the leaves of
plants is one of the essential functions of vegetable development. Not
only because water serves as the vehicle of the plant-food absorbed by
the roots and to be organized by and redistributed from the leaves,
and the aeration occurring in the latter must of necessity result in
a certain degree of evaporation; but largely because the conversion
of liquid water into vapor serves to prevent an injurious rise of
temperature in the leaves under the influence of hot sunshine and dry
air. It is undoubtedly for the latter purpose that the greater part of
the enormous amount of water required, as above stated (<a href="#Page_188">chap. 11</a>)
for the production of one part of dry substance, is actually used. When
sufficient water to supply the required evaporation through the leaves
cannot be brought up from the soil, the plant begins to wilt; or in the
case of some plants with very thin and soft leaves the blade normally
begins to droop during the hottest hours of the day; thus escaping
excessive exposure to the sun’s rays, and recovering their turgor later
in the afternoon.</p>

<div class="blockquot fs_90">
<p>The amount of water actually evaporated from orchard trees has
unfortunately not been directly determined, the investigations made
in this respect having borne mainly upon forest trees. The Austrian
Forest Experiment Station made a series of elaborate investigations on
this subject in 1878, and the following data (quoted from the Report
of the U. S. Dep’t of Agriculture for 1889) convey some idea of the
results.</p>

<p>It was found that the surface-areas of the leaves do not give
reliable results, but that these depend very largely upon the thickness
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
(mass) of the leaves. The dry weight of the latter was found, as in
the case of field crops, to correspond most nearly to the observations
made directly. It was thus found that <i>e. g.</i> birch and linden
transpired during their annual period of vegetation from 600 to 700
pounds of water per pound of dry leaves; oaks 200 to 300, while the
figures for ash, beech and maple were in between. On the other hand
the conifers—spruce, fir and pine—ranged, under the same conditions,
from 30 to 70 pounds of water only. In another year, these figures were
increased for deciduous trees to from 500 to 1000, the conifers, 75
to 200 pounds. This great variability in different seasons, together
with other elements of uncertainty, render these figures only roughly
approximate; but it will be noted that the figures for deciduous trees
are in general of the same order as those given above for field crops.
Assuming the evaporation for citrus trees to be approximately the same
as for the European evergreen oak (<i>Q. cerris</i>) viz. 500 pounds
per pound of dry matter, and taking the weighings made by Loughridge
of the leaves of a 15-year-old orange tree at Riverside as a basis (40
pounds of dry leaves), the water evaporated by each such tree would be
about 20,000 pounds per year, or about 1000 tons per acre of 100 trees.
This is equivalent to about 9 acre-inches of rainfall, out of the 35
inches commonly given.</p>
</div>

<p>Since different plants evaporate very different amounts of water
during a given time, according to their leaf-surface and the number
and size of their stomates, the maintenance of the equilibrium between
the soil-supply and the evaporation of the leaf-surface requires
correspondingly varying moisture-conditions in the soil. Therefore
desert plants, with their elaborate structural provisions against
leaf-evaporation, will develop normally, and without wilting, under
conditions which in the case of most culture plants would result in
severe injury or death. Since diminution of leaf-surface will in all
cases diminish evaporation, the heroic measure of cutting back the
twigs and branches of shrubs and trees in seasons of severe drought
is sometimes resorted to in order to save their life. In Nature this
diminution of leaf-surface may be observed in many cases of desert
plants, whose “fugacious” leaves are developed during the rainy season,
in winter and early spring; dropping off so soon as the dry season
begins, and leaving only the green surface of twigs, stems or spines to
perform the functions of the leaves.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span></p>

<p>The shading of the ground by leafy vegetation will, of course, greatly
diminish and sometimes suppress evaporation from the soil-surface; thus
very nearly fulfilling the same conditions referred to above (<a href="#Page_111">chap. 7,
page 111</a>) in discussing the effect of natural vegetation in rendering
tillage unnecessary; the beating of rains, and the formation of surface
crusts, being alike prevented. This fact is of essential importance in
contributing to the welfare of crops sown broadcast, where subsequent
cultivation is impracticable.</p>

<p><i>Weeds Waste Moisture.</i>—The injurious effects of weedy growth
among culture plants are in most cases due quite as much to the
appropriation of moisture that should have gone to the crop, as to the
abstraction of plant-food, to which the injury is generally attributed.
This is much more obvious in the arid region, where during the dry
summers every pound of moisture counts, than where summer rains obscure
this influence. It has led orchardists in California almost to an
excess of clean culture, resulting in the burning-out of the humus from
the bare surface-soil during the long, hot summers, and an injurious
compacting impossible to remedy by the most careful tillage. It thus
happens that green-manuring, the natural remedy for this evil, cannot
safely be done there with summer crops, but must be accomplished with
winter crops, such as can be turned under before the dry season begins.
The same objection holds against the growing of summer crops between
the orchard-rows.</p>

<h4>DISTRIBUTION OF MOISTURE IN THE SOIL<br> AS AFFECTED BY VEGETATION.</h4>

<p>The investigations of Wollny and others have long shown quantitatively
what common experience has taught the farmer, viz., that a field in
crops or grass is always drier within the soil-mass penetrated by the
roots than is a cultivated field bare of crops, unless perhaps when
heavily crusted on the surface. The depletion of moisture caused by
grass sward is the most easily observed because of the shallowness
of the root-system; and this is one cause at least why grass sward
does not occur naturally in the arid region, and when planted cannot
be maintained without irrigation repeated at short intervals.
Deeper-rooted plants of course deplete the soil at different and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
varying levels; and where surface roots are few or absent it may
readily happen that the surface soil is moister than the subsoil.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">This was very strikingly shown by the
investigations of Ototzky in the South-Russian steppes, in comparing
both the moisture contents and the depth of bottom water as between
forest land and the open plains. On the steppe near Chipoff, Government
of Voronej, he found the ground water at from 3 to 5 meters (10-16
feet) depth; under the forest in the same region and in identical
underground formations, the water level stood at 15 meters. In the
Black Forest near Cherson, the water is found at about 15 feet beneath
the surface; under the steppe and in cultivated ground it stood at 10
feet. At the same time the forest soil was moister in the upper two
feet than the soil of the steppe, where surface evaporation (partly
through shallow plant-roots, partly direct) was greater than under the
shadow of the forest; under which, moreover, there were few shallow
rooted plants to draw upon the moisture of the surface soil.</p>

<p>The great evaporation from forests is a matter demonstrated by actual
measurement; hence it is not surprising that certain shallow-rooted
trees should serve for the reclamation of wet ground, as has been
demonstrated on the large scale, <i>e. g.</i>, in the use of the
eucalyptus in the Pontine Marshes of Italy, and of the maritime pine in
the Landes of western France. Thus the sanitation of swampy districts
through tree-planting has become one of the established measures in
their settlement. But this refers only to the evaporation from the
trees themselves; for in the shade of the forest, a free water-surface
is found to evaporate on the average only one-third as much as in open
ground. Of course there must be a correspondingly great difference in
the amounts of evaporation from the soil-surfaces in the respective areas.</p>

<p>The great draft made by the <i>Eucalyptus globulus</i> upon
soil-moisture has been also abundantly shown in California, where
on account of its rapid growth this tree has been largely used for
windbreaks. It was found that the trees deplete the fields of moisture
for from twenty to thirty feet on either side, so as to materially
reduce crops within that limit. For this reason the pine and cypress
has of late found greater acceptance for this purpose.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span></p>

<p><i>Mulching.</i>—Covering the soil with straw or similar loose
materials to prevent waste of moisture is a common garden practice
everywhere, although not usually applicable on the large scale. It
may readily however, be carried to excess, in preventing not only
evaporation but also the warming of the soil which is so needful to
the thrifty growth of plants. It must not therefore be done too early
in the season; and after cold rains it sometimes becomes necessary
to remove the mulch in order to allow the ground to become properly
warmed. Mulching in early spring is often used to retard blooming of
trees where spring frosts are feared.</p>

<p>In the arid region, sanding of the surface is sometimes resorted to
for the prevention of the evaporation which brings alkali salts to the
surface. But the necessity of repeating this dressing annually unless
cultivation can be omitted, restricts the use of this expedient to
narrow limits.</p>

<p>The sanding of the surface of cranberry plantations in swamps or bogs
in the northern parts of the humid region doubtless owes its efficacy
largely, if not chiefly, to the retention of moisture, while at the
same time it prevents the consolidation of the surface, so as to render
tillage unnecessary.</p>

<span class="h_subtitle">ABSORPTION BY SOILS OF SOLIDS FROM SOLUTIONS.<br>
ABSORPTION OF GASES. AIR OF THE SOILS.</span></h3>
</div>

<h4>ABSORPTION OF SOLIDS FROM THEIR SOLUTIONS.</h4>

<p>Just as solids have the power of condensing gases upon their surfaces,
to an extent proportional to that surface, and therefore to the state
of fine division: so fine powders have the power of withdrawing from
solutions solids held in solution, to an extent varying with the
nature of the substance dissolved, and the absorbing solid. The most
commonly-known manifestation of this principle is that sea-water
filtering through the sands of the shore, will at a certain distance
become sensibly less brackish, and finally so nearly fresh as to be
capable of domestic use.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>
The extent to which this occurs is in a measure proportional to the
fineness of the sand, and to the amount of clay present in it. This is
a clearly physical effect, independent of any chemical action whatever;
for it occurs equally with quartz sand, charcoal, glass, limestone,
or other rock powders having no chemical effect upon the substance
dissolved or upon the liquid dissolving it. Very large amounts of water
are often required to remove all the soluble matter thus “adsorbed.”</p>

<p><i>Decolorizing Action.</i>—One of the commonest applications of this
principle is the decolorization of colored solutions by means of finely
pulverized charcoal. This property of charcoal, as is well known, is
extensively utilized in the arts, and particularly in the refining of
sugar; the charcoal used in this case being preferably bone charcoal
(“bone black”), which on account of its state of extreme fineness, and
separation by the earthy particles with which it is associated, is more
effective than any other form. It is rendered still more effective,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
however, by the extraction of these earthy particles (calcic carbonate
and phosphate) by means of acid; for by removal of the earthy
particles, the surface of the charcoal is greatly increased, and its
decolorizing as well as its absorbing power increases accordingly.</p>

<p>While in one and the same substance the decolorizing effect is more
or less directly proportional to the fineness of the particles,
corresponding to increased surface, it is nevertheless true that in
this case, as in that of the absorption of gases, there are specific
differences between different powders; so that for example no other
substance can replace charcoal in the decolorizing effect which it
produces upon colored solutions. It must not, however, be supposed
that there is any special reason why <i>coloring</i> matters, as such,
should be taken up by preference. Coloring matters are of all kinds
of chemical composition, and have in common only the fact that a
relatively small amount produces a very strong coloring effect; hence
their name, and hence also the apparently extraordinarily strong effect
produced upon them by charcoal.</p>

<p>This effect is not, however, by any means greater than it is in the
case of many other compounds which are colorless.</p>

<p><i>Complex Action of Soils.</i>—The powdery ingredients of soils,
of course, share this power with all other powders. In the case of
soils, however, the action is almost always much more complex than in
that of charcoal, because solutions that are passed through the soil
are apt to act chemically upon one or the other of its ingredients,
usually resulting in a partial exchange of ingredients between the
soil and the solution; one or more of the constituents of the solution
being retained by the soil, while one or more of the (basic) soil
constituents pass into the solution, in combination with its acidic
ingredients.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">Thus when a very dilute (½ or 1%) solution
of potassic chlorid is filtered through almost any soil, the first
portions passing through will be practically free from potash, but
will contain the chlorids of calcium and magnesium. But as more of
the solution is passed through, potash passes also ultimately without
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
absorption. In addition to the zeolitic and clay portions of the soil,
the humus is very effective in absorbing mineral ingredients from
solution, and retaining them in such manner as to be readily available
to plant growth. (<a href="#Page_124">See chap. 8, p. 124</a>.)</p>

<p>In view of the almost invariable conjunction of physical and chemical
effects, it may be fairly said that no solution, at least of mineral
salts, can pass through the soil without being changed in its
concentration and chemical composition. It is sometimes difficult to
decide to which of the two classes of effects the several changes may
be due.</p>

<p><i>Purifying Action of Soils.</i>—The disinfecting action of dry soil,
absorbing offensive gases from manure piles and from earth closets, has
already been alluded to. Similarly it is a matter of common experience
that the colored and otherwise offensive drainage from manure piles,
tanneries, dyeworks, etc., is not only deodorized but also decolorized
when passed through a sufficiently thick layer of clay soil. The
filtration through fine sand by which the drinking waters of cities
are so commonly purified before delivery to the consumer are familiar
examples of the same effects.</p>

<p>Equally familiar, however, is the fact that this power of
decolorization and retention of offensive compounds is limited; that
after a while the filtering earth or sand becomes saturated, and
afterwards the water or drainage will pass through without any sensible
purification.</p>

<p>It is therefore clear that this purifying effect of earth cannot
be relied upon for the permanent protection of wells from the
surface-drainage from barnyard or house refuse. Even if fissures or
layers of sand or gravel should not intervene so as to permit of the
direct communication of surface-drainage with wells, it is certain that
in the course of a few years at most, the intervening earth will become
so far saturated with the noxious ingredients that the latter will pass
through unhindered, and may contaminate to a considerable extent the
domestic supply of drinking water.</p>

<p><i>Waste of Fertilizers.</i>—The same, of course, holds true in regard
to manure-water, or soluble fertilizers of any kind used on the soil of
a field. The soil will retain them to a certain extent; but beyond that
limit any surplus added will be quickly washed through into the country
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
drainage by the rains. Moreover, a soil once so saturated will yield to
rain water filtering through it, notable amounts of all the ingredients
absorbed in it; and, at least so far as the physically condensed
soluble ingredients are concerned, long-continued leaching with pure
water will inevitably result in the withdrawal of additional amounts of
absorbed ingredients, apparently dividing themselves up <i>pro rata</i>
between the water and the soil.</p>

<p>It is obviously of the utmost importance to the farmer to know to what
extent the soil will retain manurial ingredients against the influence
of leaching rains; for unless this is taken into consideration, it may
readily happen that the fertilizer supplied before a rainy season will
be washed through beyond the reach of plant-roots, and so practically
become a dead loss.</p>

<p><i>Absorptive Power Varies.</i>—So far as the mere physical absorption
is concerned, it will readily be understood that a coarse sandy soil
exercises less retentive influence upon dissolved substances than clay
or humous soils. In the humid region, where sand is substantially
nothing but granular silica (<a href="#Page_86">see above, chap. 6, page 86</a>),
the same may be measurably true as regards the chemical absorption also. In the
arid region, on the contrary, a great many sandy or silt soils, very poor in
clay, exert fully as much chemical absorption as clay soils, and are
no more liable to the washing-out of soluble fertilizers introduced
than are the latter. For the chemical absorption lies chiefly in the
zeolitic portion of the soil (<a href="#Page_37">see above chap. 3, p. 37</a>),
which in the humid region accumulates in the clay, while in the arid it remains
encrusting the sand and silt grains.</p>

<p><i>Generalities regarding Chemical Absorption and Exchange.</i>—In
regard to the leaching-out and absorption or retention of substances
important to agriculture, the following general statement may be made:</p>

<p>The substances most likely to be leached out of soils are, of bases:
soda, magnesia and lime; of acidic constituents: chlorine, sulfuric
acid and nitric acid. Lime sometimes passes off with either of the
above acidic ingredients, and also in the form of carbonate.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span></p>

<p>Substances rather tenaciously retained in soils are: potash and ammonia
among the bases, and phosphoric acid among the acids.</p>

<p>Thus (as stated above) when a weak (one or two per cent) solution
of potassic chlorid or sulfate is poured upon a column of good soil
several inches thick, it will be found that the first portions passing
through are free from potash, but contain the chlorids or sulfates of
magnesium and calcium. If potassic nitrate be used, lime and magnesia
will pass off as nitrates; while in the case of potassic phosphate,
both ingredients will be retained. A solution of gypsum (calcic
sulfate) will usually cause the passing-off of some of the magnesia,
soda and potash contained in the soil, in the form of sulfates; but
the amount of potash thus dissolved soon diminishes to a mere trace.
Solutions of potassic or amnionic phosphates will be absorbed and
retained by the soil to a very considerable extent, before the soil
becomes saturated.</p>

<p>While it is true that the degree to which the soil retains the several
ingredients may serve in a very general way to indicate their richness
or poverty in the same, the attempt to make such experiments serve
to determine the agricultural needs of soils has met with but little
practical acceptance.</p>

<p><i>Drain Waters.</i>—The table on <a href="#Page_22">p. 22, chapter 2</a>,
illustrates forcibly the working of the above principles, which are verified
by the composition of drain-waters. In all, the chief nutritive ingredients of
plants, except nitrogen, are present in traces only; chlorids, nitrates
and sulfates of sodium and magnesium form the bulk of the permanently
soluble matter, with usually a considerable proportion of calcic (and
magnesic) carbonate, depending upon the amount of the earth-carbonates
present in the soil, as well as upon that of oxidizable organic
matter from which carbonic acid can be formed. That calcic carbonate
filters readily through the soil has already been somewhat elaborately
discussed (<a href="#Page_41">see chap. 3, p. 41</a>); one of the results being
that the surface soil is sometimes almost completely depleted of this important
substance, while it accumulates at a greater or less depth in the
subsoil, or in underdrains, as the case may be.</p>

<p>Of the ingredients appearing in the above list, the one of greatest
agricultural importance is nitric acid, since chlorine and sulfuric
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
acid, as well as soda, are required only in very small quantities
by most culture plants; so that they rarely need to be supplied
in fertilizers. Nitric acid, however, is not only one of the most
important fertilizers, but also the most expensive; hence the
passing-off of nitrates in drainage-water is of such serious concern
to the farmer, that the causes of its occurrence, and the means of
preventing such loss, should be fully understood. This subject will,
however, be more fully considered farther on.</p>

<p><i>The above Distinctions not Absolute.</i>—It should, however, be
also understood that while the above statements hold good in a general
way, yet the line drawn is by no means an absolute one. For just as in
the case of physical adsorption the long passing-through of distilled
water will gradually abstract the substances condensed on the surface
of the soil-grains, so an overwhelming amount of a solution of any one
kind will have a tendency to substitute its own ingredients for those
already present in the soil, removing the latter to a greater or less
extent, even in the case of potash and phosphoric acid.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">As an example in point, may be cited the
case of the natural minerals Analcite and Leucite, which Lemberg
was able to reciprocally transform from their natural condition of
soda- and potash-alumina silicates merely by alternate treatment with
solutions of potassium and sodium chlorids respectively. (<a href="#Page_37">See chap.
3, p. 37</a>). The same is true in the case of the zeolitic matter of the
soil. There is nevertheless a distinct preference in the direction of
the retention of potash as against soda; so that in the case of alkali
soils, a large excess of potash is found to be present in the zeolitic
form, notwithstanding the presence of sometimes very large amounts of
the chlorid, sulfate and carbonate of soda. This preferable retention
of potash is, of course, of material advantage in the case of the use
of soluble potash-fertilizers, as well as in preventing the waste of
the potash of the soil itself.</p>

<h4>ABSORPTION, OR CONDENSATION,<br> OF GASES BY SOILS.</h4>

<p>Like all bodies in a state of fine division, soils are capable of
absorbing a not inconsiderable amount of various gases. It may be said
that in general, other things being equal, the amount thus condensed on
the surface of the soil-grains is more or less directly proportional to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
the facility with which the gas is condensed by either pressure or
cooling. Hence the very large amount of water-gas or vapor which may
be absorbed by soils, as shown in a preceding chapter. But excepting
perhaps the case of ammonia, moist soils are less absorbent of gases
than dry ones.</p>

<p>Oxygen and nitrogen, the main constituents of the atmosphere, being
difficultly condensable by either pressure or cold, are absorbed by
soils only to a relatively small, yet by no means unimportant extent.
The condensation of oxygen within the soil-mass is doubtless of
considerable importance in the processes of oxidation, as is shown by
its partial replacement by carbonic gas in the free air of the soil
(<a href="#Page_17">see chap. 2, p. 17</a>). The intensifying of oxidizing action
caused by surface condensation is well illustrated in the case of finely divided
platinum, in which hydrogen is brought to rapid combustion when mixed
with oxygen; as well as by the effect of bedding tainted meat in
charcoal powder, when all odors of decay disappear, both by absorption
and oxidation, ammonia and carbonic gas alone ultimately escaping
through the powder.</p>

<p><i>Carbonic dioxid and ammonia gases</i>, both normal constituents of
the atmosphere, and of high importance to plant nutrition, are more
readily condensable than either oxygen or nitrogen, and consequently
may be taken up by the soil in larger relative proportions. Especially
is this the case with ammonia gas, which is not only readily condensed
by pressure, but is also extremely soluble in water; so much so that
it rushes into a tube filled with this gas almost as quickly as though
it were a vacuum. Water will absorb at the ordinary temperature,
under normal pressure, about 700 times its volume of ammonia gas; but
inasmuch as the proportion of the latter in the atmosphere amounts
to only a few millionths, the actual amount taken up can only (as
in the case of all gases) be proportional to its proportion (or
“partial pressure”) multiplied into its coefficient of absorption.
Consequently, water exposed to the ordinary air can absorb at best only
a small fraction of a per cent of ammonia. Its presence in soils can
be readily demonstrated by passing through the warmed soil a current
of purified air, which is made to bubble through Nessler’s reagent
(potassio-mercuric iodid) solution.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span></p>

<p><i>Absorption of gases by dry soils.</i>—Perfectly dry soils are
powerful absorbers of ammonia, and their absorption of this gas, as
well as of carbonic gas, can readily be shown by the arrangement shown
on the page opposite.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">The two tubes shown to the left are filled
with carbonic gas, those to the right with ammonia gas. After being
immersed in a mercurial trough, there are introduced into each tube
through the mercury small cylinders (conveniently one cubic centimeter
in volume) consisting respectively of a very sandy soil or loose
hardpan, a gray plastic clay, a gray clay soil or adobe, a very black
“adobe” clay, and a highly ferruginous and humous soil (from Hawaii),
which gives the highest absorption of all; next brown peat, and pine
charcoal. The latter, and the ferruginous soil, were also exposed for
the absorption of carbonic gas. All the absorbing cylinders are first
heated for an hour to 110°C. (218°F) for the purpose of expelling from
them moisture, air, and other absorbed gases. They are then quickly
introduced into the tubes through the mercury and allowed to absorb
the gases enclosed until the mercury columns cease to show any farther
rise; in which condition they are shown in the figure.</p>

<p>It will be seen that this absorption is a different one, not only
for each of the different substances used, but is also differently
proportioned for the two gases. For it will be noted that while the
clay soil has absorbed a very much larger amount of ammonia than the
charcoal, and the sandy soil has remained far behind both: yet the
charcoal has absorbed a considerably larger <i>proportion</i> of
carbonic gas than either the clay or the sandy soil, proving that
charcoal has a strong <i>specific</i> absorptive power for carbonic
gas, independently of the relative size of clay and charcoal particles
respectively. The sandy soil shows, by its low absorption even of
ammonia gas, the coarseness of its particles and the scarcity of clay
in its composition. The highest absorption of all is shown by the
ferruginous soil from Hawaii, containing nearly 40% of ferric oxid
together with 3⅓% of humus. The moisture-absorption of this soil at the
ordinary temperature is 19.7 per cent. The difference in the absorbing
power of the (non-humous) gray clay and gray adobe soil indicates the
strong influence of humus upon the absorption; which is still farther
emphasized by the difference between the gray and black adobe, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
latter containing 1.2% of humus. As to the peat, since its weight was
only .5 grams against an average of 2 grams for the soils employed, its
absorptive power <i>by weight</i> doubtless exceeds all other substances.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img id="FIG_51" src="images/image275.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="380" >
    <p class="f90"><span class="smcap">Fig. 51.</span>—Absorption of Carbonic and
         Ammonia Gases by different Soils.</p>
</div>

<p>While the <a href="#FIG_51">experiment shown in the figure</a> serves as a
convenient and striking demonstration for lecture purposes, it is of course not
adapted to a direct comparison of the absorbing powers of the several
substances, because of different heights of the mercurial columns
counteracting the atmospheric pressure. For direct comparative
measurement the tubes must be sunk in mercury so as to equalize the
levels inside and outside, since the corrected volumes obtained by
calculation would not serve the purpose.</p>

<p>According to special measurements made under normal atmospheric
pressure, the writer found that a black clay soil (“adobe”) absorbed
(at 60°F) over two hundred times its bulk of ammonia gas, while under
the pressure of one-fifth of an atmosphere (as shown in the photograph)
the absorption was one hundred and twenty-three times its bulk. This
energetic absorption of ammonia and related gases explains the marked
disinfecting effects which a covering of dry earth exerts in the case
of cemeteries, manure piles, and earth closets. But the difference
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
between the sandy soil and the clay soil in the amount of absorption
admonishes us that in all these cases, to secure disinfection the earth
to be used should contain as much clay as possible, and should not be
mere sand, as is sometimes the case. It also shows that the addition
of charcoal to such materials does not increase their efficacy, as has
been supposed, but that an equal bulk of clay would be more efficient.</p>

<p>Of course, so soon as the absorbing cylinders used for this experiment
are exposed to the atmosphere, the principle above stated in regard
to “partial pressure” asserts itself. The absorbed gases quickly
begin to be given off, and in some hours the equilibrium with the
ordinary conditions of the atmosphere is re-established. That the strong
absorptive power of soils for ammonia is to some extent effective
in maintaining the supply of this substance by absorption from the
atmosphere, cannot be doubted.</p>

<p>Boussingault, and later Stenhouse, determined the absorptive power of
wood charcoal for ammonia to be 90 and 98 volumes respectively.</p>

<h4>THE COMPOSITION OF GASES<br> ABSORBED FROM THE ATMOSPHERE<br>
BY VARIOUS SOLIDS.</h4>

<p>In 1864 and 1865 Reichardt and Blumtritt<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
investigated elaborately the composition of gases driven off by heat
from various powders, including soils, exposed to the atmosphere.
All the substances examined were therefore “air-dry,” therefore to a
certain extent moist; and the presence of this aqueous vapor of course
modifies in a measure the results that would have been obtained had
the materials used been exposed to dry air only. They found that,
as had already been stated by previous observers, the presence of
capillary water <i>diminishes</i> materially the absorption of gases,
especially of those not as easily absorbed by water as are carbonic
gas and ammonia. Contrary to what might have been expected from the
more ready condensation of oxygen by pressure or cold, in nearly
all cases nitrogen is absorbed to a greater extent than oxygen, and
sometimes exclusively so; so that in some cases the latter was found
to be present only in traces, as will be perceived from the subjoined table:

by equal weights of any one substance was in the case of carbonate
of magnesia; but it is quite probable that in part, at least, this
large amount of gas was due to the evolution of carbonic gas from the
easily decomposable carbonate; the more as the analysis of the gases
shows over 29% of carbonic gas. But the highest absorption by equal
<i>volumes</i> of any substance is shown by the ferric hydrate; next
to this by the light poplar charcoal, and next by the carbonate of
magnesia. The high absorptive power here shown by the ferric hydrate
is of great interest in connection with the facts already stated
regarding the absorption of moisture and ammonia by ferruginous soils
(<a href="#Page_274">see page 274, this chapter</a>); and the fact that the
larger proportion of the gas—as much as 70% in one case—consisted of carbonic
gas, is particularly interesting in the same connection. Both in the amount
of gas contained, and in the proportion of carbonic gas therein, the
ferric hydrate exceeds even peat, the representative of humus in
soils. It will, however, be noted that in the garden soil, also, the
proportion of carbonic gas is very large, while that of oxygen is very
low. It is curious to note that in very few cases the proportion of
oxygen to nitrogen is the same as in the atmosphere; in most cases the
nitrogen predominates considerably beyond its normal proportion, and in
two cases, that of charcoal and of calcic carbonate (whiting), the gas
was found to consist of pure nitrogen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
We are forced to conclude that the substances here enumerated, as a
rule, condense oxygen in smaller proportions than they do nitrogen, or
carbonic gas. As regards the carbon monoxid mentioned in the table, it
is doubtful that it was contained as such in the substance originally
examined; it may readily have been formed under the influence of the
heat required in expelling the gases from the substances containing
organic matter. Among the important results shown in the table, is the
comparative determination of the gases in moist, and in dry garden
earth, showing that in the moist earth the amount of gas absorbed
ranged from less than one-half down to almost one-fourth that absorbed
by the dry. The importance of these differences in the case of the
fallow can readily be appreciated.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">The changes in the absorptive power
brought about by wetting and drying, as shown in the above table, are
very insignificant. In the case of the charcoal, soil and silt the
diminution may fairly be assumed to be caused by the deposition of
soluble salts on the surface, partly clogging the pores. In the case of
the clay as well as in that of the river silt, the inevitable content
of organic matter in process of decomposition has doubtless influenced
the result, as is suggested by the increase of carbonic gas. That
prepared chalk should in one case contain exclusively nitrogen gas, in
the other case mixed gases, seems to indicate a difference in the air
to which it is exposed, or in the water employed in its preparation;
the latter case agreeing substantially with the results obtained from
the precipitated carbonate. In both (as well as in the carbonates of
barium and strontium), the absorption of carbonic gas is very small, or
<i>nil</i>.</p>

<p>It thus appears that for the condensation of carbonic dioxid gas,
ferric and aluminic hydrates are prepotent among mineral substances;
while clays, river silts and soils may always be expected to contain
relatively large proportions of this gas in absorption.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span></p>

<h4>THE AIR OF SOILS.</h4>

<p><i>The Empty Space in Soils.</i>—In dry soils the empty space,
usually amounting to from 35 to 50 per cent of its volume, is filled
with air;<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
in moist or wet soils the space unoccupied by water is similarly
filled. Hence when soils are in their best condition for the support of
vegetation (<a href="#Page_202">chap. 11, p. 202</a>), about one half of their
interstices is filled with water, the other half with air. Actual measurements
of the amount of air contained in well-cultivated garden soil have been shown
by Boussingault and Levy to range between 10,000 and 12,000 cubic feet
per acre, substantially agreeing, therefore, with the above statement.
In uncultivated forest soil, on the contrary, they found only from
somewhat less than 4000 to 6000 cubic feet of air per acre. Extended
observations since carried out by Wollny, Ebermayer, and others have
in general confirmed the earlier observations, while adding greatly to
their significance in respect to their relations to plant growth, and
to the process of humification and soil-formation.</p>

<p>As a matter of course, when water evaporates from the soil in drying,
its place is taken by air so far as it is not filled by capillary water
drawn from below.</p>

<p><i>Functions of Air in Soils.</i>—That roots require for the
performance of their vegetative functions the presence of oxygen,
has already been discussed; but there can be no question that the
higher productiveness of well-cultivated soils is largely due to
the greater and readier access of air to the roots. Apart from this
direct function, however, the presence of oxygen in the soil serves
other important purposes, and among these doubtless the most dominant
is the promotion of the oxidation of the organic matter of the soil
through the agency of micro-organisms; and more particularly that
of nitrification, which chiefly governs the supply of nitrogen to
non-leguminous plants. In the case of leguminous plants, the presence
of air as a furnisher of nitrogen as well as oxygen is absolutely essential.</p>

<p>The injurious effects of insufficient aeration of the soil have been
repeatedly referred to already (pp. <a href="#Page_45">45</a>,
<a href="#Page_76">76</a>). In water-logged soils
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
reductive fermentations are soon set up, and the nitrates of the
soils are reduced partly with the evolution of nitrogen gas, partly
to ammonia; while their oxygen is consumed to supply the demands of
the roots. Ferric oxid is reduced to ferrous carbonate, sulfates to
sulfids; thus deranging the whole process of plant-nutrition and
absorption of plant-food. If continued for any length of time these
conditions end in the death of the plant. Too much importance cannot
therefore be attached to the proper aeration of the soil and subsoil.</p>

<p><i>Excessive Aeration; Compacting the Soil.</i>—On the other hand,
excessive aeration of the soil may be injurious in causing a serious
waste of moisture; especially in arid climates, where the hot, dry
winds may readily destroy the germinating power of the swollen seed
when the seed-bed is too loose and open, and later may injure or
destroy the feeding roots. The abundant growth of grain often seen in
the tracks of a wagon carrying the centrifugal sower, when the stand in
the general surface is very scanty, is usually due to the consolidation
of the seed-bed, and suggests at once the well-known efficacy of light
rolling to insure quicker germination and a better stand. Similarly,
the rolling of grain fields in spring is often the saving clause for
a crop in dry years. But such needful consolidation must not, of
course, be carried to the extent of creating a surface crust which
would subsequently serve to waste the subsoil moisture. Hence, the
soil-surface should be rather dry when rolling is resorted to.</p>

<p>The pressing of the earth around transplanted plants, similarly, is
a needful precaution, not only with respect to the drying-out of the
soil, but also to insure close contact between the roots and the soil.</p>

<p><i>The Composition of the Free Air of the Soil</i> usually differs
from the air above, in that besides being saturated with moisture,
its nitrogen-content is slightly increased (by one-half to over one
per cent); the oxygen-content on the other hand, is diminished, being
in part (sometimes nearly to the extent of one-half of its volume)
replaced by carbonic gas, derived partly from its secretion by the
roots, partly from the oxidation of organic substances. It naturally
follows that the richer the soil in the latter, the more carbonic gas
will be formed under favoring conditions; so that in freshly-manured
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
land the amount of oxygen transformed into carbonic gas will be
greatest, while in the surface-soil of ordinary fields, carbonic gas
rarely reaches to as much as one per cent. In all cases, however, the
content of carbonic gas in the air of the soil is materially higher
than that of the air above it, and thus serves to intensify greatly
the solvent and disintegrating effect of the soil water upon the soil
materials (<a href="#Page_17">see chap. 2, p. 17</a>). The soil-mass itself, however,
retains carbonic dioxid with considerable tenacity, so that it is not possible
to wash it out completely by filtering water through it. When water
containing carbonic gas in solution is filtered through the soil, the
gas is sometimes completely absorbed, the water passing off free from gas.</p>

<p>The presence of free carbonic gas in soils is readily demonstrated by
passing through the warmed soil a current of air, which is then made to
bubble through lime water; a clouding of the latter, and the ultimate
formation of a precipitate of calcic carbonate, proves the presence of
the gas, and may also serve to measure its amount.</p>

<p>From the fact that the free air in normal soils may contain as much as
one-fortieth of its bulk of carbonic gas, besides what may be contained
in the condensed form, we may conclude that this gas is formed within
them with considerable rapidity; for otherwise, in view of the free
communication and diffusion with the outer air, such large amounts
could not be maintained in the surface-soil. Doubtless a considerable
proportion of the carbonic gas normally contained in the atmosphere is
thus supplied from within the soil itself.</p>

<p><i>Relation of Carbonic Gas to Bacterial and Fungous Activity.</i>—It
has been fully demonstrated by the researches of Koch, Miquel, Adametz,
Fuelles, Wollny and others, that the formation of carbonic gas in the
soil is not a purely chemical oxidation process, but is essentially
dependent upon the presence and life-activity of numerous kinds of
organisms, bacterial as well as fungous. The crucial proof of this fact
is that the presence of any antiseptic diminishes, and if exceeding
certain proportions completely suppresses, the formation of carbonic
gas; while on the other hand all conditions known to be favorable to
the life of such organisms, viz., the proper conditions of temperature
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
and moisture (varying with different kinds), increase the formation
of the gas. Such formation is of course, however, conditioned upon
the presence of oxygen. In the case of most bacteria, there is a
certain limit beyond which the presence of their own product exerts
an injurious or repressive effect upon their activity; so that if the
gas accumulates beyond that limit, the rate of its formation decreases
despite of otherwise favorable conditions.</p>

<p>It follows that the best life-conditions of these organisms (even
when anerobic) cannot be fulfilled below a certain limited depth in
the soil; and all observations show that their number decreases very
rapidly with increasing depth (<a href="#Page_142">see chap. 9, p. 142</a>),
varying with the perviousness of the soil, but rarely exceeding four
or five feet in the humid regions; though doubtless found at greater
depths in the arid climates. It is also obvious that the use of any
antiseptic or poisonous materials on the field or in the manure pile
will tend to disturb and restrain the useful activity of these organisms.</p>

<p><i>Putrefactive Processes.</i>—Carbonic gas is formed also, but to a
much more limited extent, in <i>putrefactive processes</i>, occurring
in the absence, or with only limited access, of air or oxygen. These
processes likewise are conditioned upon the presence or activity of
(largely anerobic) bacteria; but they should not occur in normally
constituted, and especially in tilled soils, being as a rule inimical
to the growth of cultivated plants (<a href="#Page_145">see chap. 9, p. 145</a>).</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle">THE COLORS OF SOILS.</span></h3>
</div>

<p>The natural coloration of soils forms a prominent part of the
characters upon which farmers are wont to base their judgment of
land quality; hence the origin and value of soil-colors deserve
consideration.</p>

<p><i>Black Soils.</i>—From the oldest times down to the present a
“rich, black soil” has commanded attention and approval. The black
and brown-black colors being almost invariably due to the presence
of much humus (very rarely to an admixture of carbon [graphite], of
magnetic oxid of iron, or sesquioxid of manganese), it is obvious
that the farmers’ judgment coincides with a high estimate of the
agricultural value of humus. A discussion of this point will be found
in another place; but the popular judgment is based quite as much
upon the experience had in the advantages that usually accompany the
presence of humus. It largely characterizes low grounds, and therefore
alluvial lands, whose richness is due to far more general causes. But
the <i>shade</i> of the blackness seen in the soil deserves and usually
receives close consideration. If tending toward brown, acid humus or
“sour” land is indicated; unless indeed the surface soil should be
bodily derived from decayed wood, as in the primeval forests. Forest
soils in general are usually dark-tinted for some inches near the
surface, owing to the presence of leaf mold, and mostly have an acid
reaction.</p>

<p>But the black tint is equally welcome to the land-seeker when seen
outside of alluvial and forest areas. Belts of “black lands” appear on
hillsides and plateaus; and these lands, though clearly not alluvial,
are also found to be preëminently productive; witness the upland
prairies of the western and southern United States. These black soils
are always characterized by the presence of a full supply of lime in
the form of carbonate, under the influence of which the most deeply
black humus is formed. In other words, the jet black tint is indicative
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
of calcareous lands; and these, as will be more fully shown below, are
almost always highly productive.</p>

<p>From both points of view, then, the favorable judgment passed upon
black soils by practical men is justified.</p>

<p>But it is not necessarily true that soils showing no obvious black tint
are poor in humus; for in strongly ferruginous or “red” soils its tint
is frequently wholly obscured, though when still visible it gives rise
to the laudatory name of “mahogany land,” which every farmer considers
a prize.</p>

<p>Of course then it would be wholly incorrect to judge of the
agricultural value of land from its humus-content alone; for its color
may be entirely imperceptible and yet its amount and nitrogen content
be fully adequate to the requirements of thrifty vegetation. Gray and
even whitish soils very frequently fall within this category in the
arid region.</p>

<p>The black tint is also favorable to the absorption of the sun’s heat,
and is therefore conducive to earlier maturity than is to be looked for
in light-tinted lands similarly located.</p>

<p>Wollny (Forsch. Agr. Phys. Vol. 12, 1889, p. 385), discusses the
influence of color on soils in relation to moisture and content of
carbonic acid. The results show in general simply the effects due
to increase of temperature when the soils are either darker-colored
throughout, or made so superficially.</p>

<p><i>“Red” Soils.</i>—Next to a black soil, a “red” one will usually
command the instinctive approval of farmers. The cause of this
preference is not as obvious as in the case of the black tints; but
the general consensus of opinion requires an examination of its
claims. It is of course easy enough to adduce examples of very poor
“red” soils, derived from ferruginous sandstones that supply little
else than quartz and ferric hydrate; the Cotton States supply cogent
examples in point, as do also the lower Foothills of the Sierra Nevada
of California. It is not, therefore, the iron rust or ferric hydrate
that renders the land productive; but its presence is a sign of some
favorable conditions. First among these is, that ferric hydrate cannot
continue to exist in badly drained soils; a “red” soil is therefore a
well-drained one, and this is probably one of the chief causes of the
popular preference. The “white land” sometimes seem in tracts otherwise
colored with iron, is distinctly inferior in production to the red
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
lands; and examination will generally show that from some cause, such
white lands have been subjected to the watery maceration which proves
so injurious (<a href="#Page_46">see chap. 3, p. 46</a>,
<a href="#Page_231">chap. 12, p. 231</a>).</p>

<p>That finely-diffused ferric hydrate has a very high power of absorbing
moisture as well as other gases of the atmosphere, has been shown in
the preceding chapter; it stands in this respect next to humus itself,
and hence highly ferruginous soils need not contain as much humus as
“white” soils from this point of view. Like humus, also, it renders
heavy clay soils more easily tillable.</p>

<p><i>Origin of Red Tints.</i>—Where crystalline rocks prevail, the
red tint usually indicates the derivation from the weathering of
hornblende; implying also, outside of the tropics, the presence of
sufficient lime in the land. Such lands are naturally preferred to
those of lighter tints derived from purely feldspathic rocks
(<a href="#Page_32">see chap. 3, p. 32</a>), although they may
be poorer in potash than the latter.</p>

<p>But the red tint has also its intrinsic advantages in the more ready
absorption of the sun’s heat by the colored than by a white surface.
This is probably the chief cause of the higher quality of wines
grown on red hillsides in the middle and northern vine districts of
Europe, where everything that aids earlier maturity is of the greatest
importance. The function of ferric oxid as a carrier of oxygen
(<a href="#Page_45">chap. 4, p. 45</a>) probably also aids nitrification.</p>

<p>“Yellow” lands owe their tint, of course, to smaller amounts of ferric
hydrate, but share more or less in the advantages of the “red.”</p>

<p><i>White</i> soils, or more properly those having very light gray
tints, are not usually looked upon with favor, especially in the humid
region. The causes of the unfavorable judgment current among farmers
in respect to white soils has already been partially explained in
the discussion of the black and red tints. The light color means the
scarcity or absence of both humus and ferric hydrate, and usually
implies that the soil has been subject to reductive maceration through
the influence of stagnant water; reducing the ferric hydrate to ferrous
salts, oxidizing away the humus, and accumulating in the form of inert
concretions most or all of the lime, iron and phosphoric acid of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
soil mass (<a href="#Page_46">see chap. 3, p. 46</a>,
<a href="#Page_184">chap. 10, p. 184</a>). The term “crawfishy,”
so commonly applied to white soils in the eastern United States,
expresses well the usual condition of the white soils of that region;
which are very commonly inhabited by crayfish, whose holes reach
water a few feet below ground, and are surrounded on the outside by
piles of white subsoil mixed with “black gravel” or concretions of
bog iron ore. It is needless to say why such lands cannot command
the favorable consideration of the farmer; they cannot as a rule be
cultivated without previous drainage, and even after that will usually
prove unthrifty, “raw,” and in immediate need of fertilization by
green-manuring, and the use of phosphates.</p>

<p>In the arid region, lands of this character are of rare occurrence,
while (as has been explained above, <a href="#Page_135">chap. 8, p. 135</a>), the
light gray or “white” tints are there a very common characteristic of even the
very best soils. It is true that they are poor in humus and in finely
diffused ferric hydrate; but their “light” texture renders the presence
of humus for this purpose less needful, and as stated elsewhere
(<a href="#Page_135">see chap. 8, p. 135</a>), the high nitrogen-content
of arid humus renders a smaller supply adequate for vegetative
purposes. As to iron, its presence being more important as a sign of
good drainage and aeration than directly, its absence from soils of
great depth and loose texture is of no consequence; especially when the
heat-absorption which it favors is not only not needed, but is usually
already in undesirable excess during the hot summers.</p>

<p><i>White Alkali Spots.</i>—In the valleys of the arid region, however,
<i>very</i> white spots commonly indicate the prevalence of alkali
salts, and to that extent are an unfavorable indication; especially
when coupled with the occurrence of black rings or spots, which
indicate the presence of black alkali or carbonate of soda
(<a href="#Page_422">see chap. 22</a>).</p>

<span class="h_subtitle">CLIMATE.</span></h3>
</div>

<p><i>Heat and Moisture</i> are the main governing conditions of plant
growth. In a preceding chapter the relations of soils and plant growth
to water have been considered; in the present one the relations of both
moisture and heat to soils and plants will be discussed; and to do
this intelligibly to those not making a specialty of such studies, it
becomes necessary to introduce, first, a summary consideration of the
subject of climate.</p>

<p>Climatic conditions control, and to a great extent determine, the
industrial pursuits of every country; all the more so as the rapid
communication and transportation by means of modern appliances now
brings every part of the globe in competition with every other. The
question is not now what it may be intrinsically possible to do under
certain climatic and geographical conditions, but whether these things
can be done with a reasonable prospect of profit and commercial
success, in competition with other countries offering more or less
of similar possibilities. While it is true that the cost of labor
frequently enters most heavily into such problems, yet favorable or
unfavorable climatic or soil-conditions may in many cases turn the
scale. Thus the high price of labor and fuel on the Pacific coast of
the United States would at first blush seem to render competition
with Europe and the East in the production of beet sugar commercially
impossible; yet exceptionally favorable climatic and soil-conditions
concur to turn the scale in favor of California at least, so as to have
placed that state at the head of the sugar-producing states of the
Union. A general understanding of the climatic conditions which concern
the United States more or less directly, is therefore needful to an
appreciation of their agricultural possibilities.</p>

<p><i>Climatic Conditions.</i>—The factors usually mentioned as
constituting climate are temperature, rainfall and winds. Since the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
latter two factors, however, are themselves merely the result of
<i>heat</i> conditions, it is proper to discuss from the outset the
origin and mode of action of heat.</p>

<h4>TEMPERATURE.</h4>

<p>The temperature of stellar space outside of the atmosphere is
known to be very low. The increasing cold as we ascend to greater
heights, is a fact familiar to all. Langley has calculated upon the
basis of observations made at the summit and foot of Mount Whitney
in California, that the temperature of space lies near 200° Cent.
(360° F.) below the freezing point of water; and this would be the
temperature near the Earth’s surface, were it not for the surrounding
atmosphere. The latter absorbs but a small amount of the sun’s direct
heat rays (which are of <i>high</i> intensity), as they penetrate it
to the Earth’s surface. But as the earth’s surface is warmed, the heat
rays of <i>low</i> intensity which it emits cannot pass back through
the atmosphere to the sun or to outer space; they are “trapped,” as
it were, by the dense air resting near the earth’s surface, which is
then warmed partly by the radiation from, partly by direct contact
with, the soil. It is to the existence of our atmosphere, then, that
the possibility of our animal and vegetable life in their present form
is due; and a decrease of the trapping effect on the sun’s heat rays
makes itself quickly felt when ascending, either in balloons or on
high mountains. Moreover, it is well known to mountain climbers that
at great elevations the sun’s heat is extremely intense at noon; even
though the temperature may fall to the freezing point at night, owing
to the failure of the thin air to prevent the radiation back into space
of the heat absorbed during the day. On the high plateaus of the Andes
and of Asia, therefore, very extreme climates prevail, on account of
the great range of temperature between day and night.</p>

<p><i>Ascertainment and Presentation of Temperature-Conditions.</i>—The
proper understanding of the temperature conditions of any locality
or region is by no means a simple matter. Shall we study the daily,
monthly, or annual changes of temperature, or the means deduced from
either or all of them, in order to gain a clear insight into the
climatic conditions that control crop production and health conditions?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span></p>

<p><i>The Annual Mean Temperature not a Good Criterion.</i>—Since one and
the same figure may result equally from the averaging of two widely
divergent data, and from such as are close together, it is clear that
the mean <i>annual</i> temperature cannot be a proper criterion of the
agricultural adaptations of a country. Thus an average temperature of
60° F. might result, equally, from the averaging of 65 and 55 degrees,
or from taking the mean of 15 and 105 degrees; yet the respective
cultural adaptations would be widely different.</p>

<p><i>Extremes of Temperature are Most Important.</i>—It is, on the
contrary, rather the <i>extremes</i> of temperature, more particularly
of cold, but frequently also of heat, together with the total amount
of heat available during the growing season, that determines such
adaptation so far as temperature is concerned; for no culture plant
can be successfully grown where the temperature during winter even
occasionally falls for more than a few hours below the point which
it can resist; and for each plant there is a certain aggregate
requirement of heat to carry it from germination to fruiting. Even
different varieties of one and the same plant differ materially in the
latter respect, so that it is very important that in the selection of
varieties to be grown, this factor should be taken into consideration.
It cannot be too strongly urged that the comparison of annual means of
temperature, so commonly made by promoters of colonization schemes,
must not be taken as a guide either in the estimate of cultures in
which the immigrant may desire to engage, or by those in search of a
climate adapted to their health-conditions.</p>

<p><i>Seasonal and Monthly Means.</i>—The statement of the mean
temperatures of the conventional four seasons—spring, summer, autumn
and winter—afford a much clearer conception of climatic adaptations;
provided always that the extreme temperatures be considered at the same
time. With the same understanding, the monthly means are still more
instructive; but here again, it is most essential that the distribution
and amount of rainfall in each be regarded at the same time, since the
most desirable temperature is of no avail without the moisture required
for vegetation.</p>

<p>In some cases, <i>e. g.</i>, that of California, it becomes necessary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
for practical purposes to regard the “season,” and not the calendar
year, as the unit or reference for crop production. There the crops
depend upon what rainfall may occur from October to May, there being
no summer rains of agricultural significance, and outside of irrigated
lands, almost all vegetation save that of trees being in abeyance. In
India, there are two distinct growing seasons (“kharif” and “rabi”),
corresponding to the two “monsoon” seasons; and no matter how much rain
may fall during <i>one</i>, almost total failure may occur in other
tropical and arid sections of that country.</p>

<p>The <i>Daily Variations</i> are of interest chiefly with respect to
health conditions, since most plants are more adaptable in this respect
than the average man.</p>

<h4>RAINFALL.</h4>

<p><i>Distribution Most Important.</i>—The summary statements of the
annual rainfall are almost equally as deceptive as are those of annual
mean temperature, since quite as much depends on the manner in which
it is distributed through the year, as upon its absolute amount; and
also upon the manner of its fall. Thus Central Montana has the same
aggregate annual rainfall as the country surrounding the Bay of San
Francisco, viz. about 24 inches; but while in the Franciscan climate
this amount of rain falls during one-half of the year, and that the
growing season, enabling crops to be grown without irrigation, in
Montana the rainfall is distributed over the entire season, so that
irrigation is absolutely essential for the successful production of
crops. This so much the more as, while the winter snowfall is very
light, the rains of summer are largely torrential, running off the
surface in muddy floods and giving little time for absorption into the
soil. Farther west, in Washington, where grain crops are largely grown
without irrigation, the sowing of winter grain is impracticable because
the dry summer is immediately followed by the very light snowfall of
winter, which falls on dry ground. Fall-sown grain would thus simply
lie dormant in the ground through the winter, with great liability
to injury from stress of weather in early spring, apart from the
depredations of birds and rodents. Hence grain is always sown there in

<p>These examples may suffice to show that summary statements of either
temperature or rainfall by yearly means are of little practical
interest to the farmer. What he needs to know is whether or not
sufficient rains to mature a full crop are likely to fall during the
time that the growing temperature prevails; and what are the minima and
maxima of temperature—heat and cold—that his crops will be called
upon to endure.</p>

<h4>WINDS.</h4>

<p>The third climatic factor mentioned, the winds, though proverbial for
their unreliability and inconstancy, are not only very incisive in
their action, but also to a considerable extent of very definite local
or regional occurrence and significance. Moreover, their occurrence,
direction, temperature and moisture-condition can, in regions whose
climatology has been reasonably well studied, be foretold with
sufficient accuracy to be of great use to the farmer.</p>

<p><i>Heat the Cause of Winds.</i>—As already stated, the primary cause
of all winds is heat, substantially on the principle according to which
draught is created in our domestic fires. The hot air rising creates an
indraught from all directions, especially from that which it can most
readily come; viz., from the ocean,<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>
or from level lands, rather than across mountain chains. Hence the
sea-breeze in the after part of the day, when the land has become
heated; while the sea, requiring a much larger amount of heat to change
its temperature to a similar extent, remains relatively cool. But at
night the earth cools more rapidly than the sea, by radiation; hence
toward evening the sea-breeze dies down, and toward and after sunset
the land-breeze takes its place.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span></p>

<p>The principle of this local change of winds, together with the rotation
of the earth, the absorption of moisture by air, and the fact that the
latter becomes cooler when it expands on rising and warmer when it is
compressed by descending, serves to explain all the major phenomena
usually observed in connection with winds. The air of the equatorial
belt, heated throughout the year, necessarily rises and creates an
indraught from both north and south; but since the air thus flowing in
has a lower rotary velocity than the earth’s surface at the Equator,
it lags behind and so gives rise to northeast and southeast winds,
respectively, between the two tropics and the equatorial belt. These
regular winds, from the aid they give to commerce in passing from
continent to continent, are known as the <i>trade winds</i>. On the
other hand, the air that has risen from the hot equatorial belt,
cooling by expansion as it rises and flowing northward and southward
from the Equator, on descending as it mainly does into the temperate
zones, has a higher rotary velocity than the land-surface and so
tends to give rise to southwest and northwest winds in the northern
and southern hemispheres respectively. At sea, on coasts and in level
inland regions to windward of mountain chains, such winds are often
quite regular during a portion of the year.</p>

<p><i>Cyclones.</i>—But local disturbances arising from heated land
areas or mountain slopes, as well as wide atmospheric changes whose
causes are not fully understood, give rise to waves of alternating
high and low barometric pressure, largely converting rectilinear or
slightly curved wind-motion into whirls or “cyclones”<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>
ranging from a thousand to over two thousand miles in diameter. These
in the case of low-pressure waves or centers, <i>toward</i> which the
air flows from the <i>outside</i>, revolve in the direction contrary to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
the movement of the hands of a clock, and commonly produce rain in
their east portion. A high-pressure wave or center, <i>from</i> which
the air naturally flows toward the <i>outside</i>, will usually bring
about an “anti-cyclone” area with fair, and in winter cold (“blizzard”)
weather, the direction of the whirl being, in this case, the reverse,
or in the same direction as the hands of a clock. Both cyclones and
anti-cyclones move in North America from west to east, mostly entering
from the Pacific Ocean off the northwest coast and traversing the
continent with a slight southeast (or in the case of cold weather
almost south) trend, with a velocity of twenty to thirty miles an hour;
until upon reaching the region of the Great Lakes they generally turn
northeastward and pass into the Atlantic Ocean from the New England
and Canada coasts.—It is upon these general facts, roughly outlined
here, that the weather forecasts are in the main based; taking into
consideration, of course, the local or regional conditions, topography,
etc., which modify the application of the general rules.</p>

<p>In the southern hemisphere, the air-movements substantially correspond
to those observed in the northern, so far as not modified by mountain
chains; as is especially the case in South America.</p>

<h4>INFLUENCE OF TOPOGRAPHY.</h4>

<p><i>Rains to Windward of Mountain Chains.</i>—The surface features or
topography of the regions traversed by the air currents or winds may
materially modify both their direction and their physical condition,
especially as to moisture and temperature. Mountain chains may deflect
them, or, causing the air currents to rise on their slopes, and thus to
cool by expansion, the moisture these bring with them from the sea may
be partially, or sometimes almost wholly, deposited in the form of rain
or snow; chiefly on the windward slopes. Then, continuing across the
range, the air deprived of most of its moisture cannot readily yield
up more; hence the scarcity of rain—“arid climate”—under the lee of
mountain chains; as in the Great Basin between the Sierra Nevada and
Cascade ranges on the one hand and the Rocky Mountains on the other,
and also on the Great Plains under the lee of the latter. The abundant
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
rainfall between the Mississippi river and the Atlantic coast is due to
the moist winds coming from the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico and
Caribbean sea, whose access is not interfered with by any cross-ranges
of mountains. But the Great Plains lying between the Mississippi and
the Rocky Mountains are not within the sweep of the Gulf winds, whose
trend is SW to NE; while they are equally out of reach of moisture
from the Pacific, all that having been successively deposited on the
intervening mountains; hence their deficient rainfall.</p>

<p>Northward of the temperate zone the rainfall generally decreases as we
approach the arctic regions; except where the influence of warm ocean
currents to windward creates comparatively local exceptions, as in the
case of Norway and Alaska.</p>

        distribution of Rainfall in<br> Europe, Africa and America projected
        on 100 Meridian W. L.</p>
</div>

<p><i>The general Distribution of Rainfall</i> on the globe is well shown
in the annexed diagram, which is copied by permission of the author
from his treatise on the “Evolution of Climates,”<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>
and represents the mean deduced from data given in the Atlas of Meteorology
by J. G. Bartholomew. It is a composite curve derived from the consolidation
of four curves showing the distribution of rainfall, viz., on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
meridians of 20°E.L.; the west coasts of Europe and Africa; the 30th
meridian W.L., in the Atlantic Ocean; and the west coasts of North
and South America, projected on the plane of the 100th meridian W.L.
The latter curve corresponds with remarkable closeness to the mean
curve here given. “It is not intended that these curves should include
the rainfall upon meridians on which the distribution in belts is
interrupted by continental influences, and by the irregular oblique
belts of rain on the east coasts.” But it presents an admirable generalization
upon which, as a basis, the local disturbances may be studied.</p>

<p>It will be noted that the maximum of rainfall in the tropical rain-belt
lies several degrees to northward of the equator, owing doubtless to
the greater land area in the northern hemisphere. There is thus, on
the whole, a narrower belt of deficient rainfall or aridity between
the tropical and <i>northern</i> temperate rain-belts, than in the
<i>southern</i> hemisphere. The southern temperate rain-belt touches
only the extreme ends of South America, Africa and New Zealand;
elsewhere on the ocean it has not been sufficiently observed as yet.
The zones of rainfall and aridity are, however, known to be subject
to seasonal oscillations of several degrees in latitude, owing to the
obliquity of the plane of the ecliptic, which shifts its position upon
that of the equator.</p>

<p><i>Ocean Currents.</i>—Since water as a fluid is subject to the same
circulatory motions which cause winds, it is to be expected that
ocean currents should exist corresponding to those of the air, as
characterized in general above. But as water warms so much more slowly
than air, its circulation would be comparatively insensible were it
not for the effects produced by the air currents upon the surface of
the sea, combined, as in the case of the winds, with the effects of
the rotation of the earth. Without going into the details of the ocean
currents in the tropics, it may suffice to say that owing partly to the
moving and warming effects of winds, partly to the natural circulatory
motion of the water, two great warm currents flow from the tropics
northward, materially modifying what would otherwise be the climates of
the coasts they touch.</p>

<p><i>The Gulf Stream.</i>—The current most generally known is the Gulf
Stream, flowing partly from the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
partly from outside of the same along the chain of the Lesser Antilles,
along the southeast coast of the United States (Florida, Georgia and
South Carolina); but owing to its greater rotational velocity it is
soon, like the winds of the same latitudes, deflected from a northward
to a NE. course, which carries it away from the American coast, to
impart some of its warmth, (probably mainly through the winds that blow
over it), to Great Britain and Ireland, Scandinavia, and Western Europe
generally; while the northern American coast is left to be bathed by
the icy polar current flowing from the Arctic through Baffin’s Bay,
which carries icebergs far to the south in the way of the transatlantic
traffic between the Eastern States and Europe, and causes a difference
in climate that is well exemplified in the comparison of the climate
of New York with that of Naples, both lying in the same latitude; and
similarly of the bleak coast of Labrador with that of Great Britain.</p>

<p><i>The Japan Stream.</i>—On the eastern Asiatic Coast, a warm current
originating in the Sunda seas, flows off the coasts of the Philippines
and of China and bathes the Japanese islands; hence it is known as
the Japanese Current, or Kuro-siro. It is partly this current which,
failing to pass into the Arctic through the shallow waters of Behring
strait, renders the coast climates of the northwest coast of America
so much milder and moister than is that in corresponding latitudes on
the east coasts of both continents. Alaska corresponds to Norway in
its moist, foggy and relatively mild coast climate; British Columbia,
Washington and Oregon participate in the benefits of the tempering
influence of the return current of the Kuro-siro. But as this return
(“Alaska”) current passes southward into the warmer seas off the
California coast, its influence is reversed; it becomes a cold current
in the warm waters of the Pacific, and the warm, moist air of the ocean
being carried by the westerly winds across this cold stream which flows
along the shore of California, in summer dense fogs are formed, which
render navigation difficult and produce a coast climate whose average
summer and winter temperatures (<i>e. g.</i> at San Francisco) may
differ by only a few degrees, viz., 15.5 and 13.0° C. (60 and 56° F.);
so that a change of clothing from season to season is hardly called
for. The Alaska Current leaves the immediate coast of California off Pt.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>
Conception near Santa Barbara, gradually losing itself southwestward,
but still tempering the tropical heat in the Hawaiian Islands. Hence
the coast climate is much warmer and less foggy in southern California;
but throughout the State in the interior valleys, screened from the
coast winds by the Coast ranges, the temperature in summer may rise
several degrees above 100° F. for days together; although, owing to the
dryness of the air, the heat is not oppressive.</p>

<p><i>Contrasting Climates in N. W. America.</i>—An even more striking
contrast, showing the effects of the warm ocean and air currents, when
intercepted by mountain chains, exists on the Pacific coast farther
northward, as already mentioned. In Oregon and Washington first the
low Coast ranges, and then the higher Cascade mountains, obstruct
the eastward progress of the westerly ocean winds. The result is a
very heavy rainfall to coastward of and within the Coast ranges, and
an almost equally heavy precipitation on the western slope of the
Cascades. Standing on the crest of the latter in summer, one may see to
westward a rolling sea of clouds, causing almost daily rains; while to
eastward the eye ranges over brown or whitish, dusty plains or rolling
lands, almost destitute of tree growth and quivering with heat, under a
deep blue sky untroubled by clouds for months.</p>

<p>A somewhat similar contrast is seen in the Hawaiian islands, which are
in the sweep of the subtropical northeast trade winds, and on their
windward (eastern) slopes have abundant rains; while on the leeward
slopes an almost arid climate prevails, calling for extended irrigation.</p>

<p><i>Continental, Coast and Insular Climates.</i>—From what has been
said above, the striking differences of climate caused by the position
of any region with reference to the sea or other large bodies of water
on the one hand, and to mountain chains on the other, can be readily
understood; provided of course that the direction of the winds and the
trend of the mountain chains be properly taken into consideration.
Western coasts in the temperate and subtropical regions will have a
relatively even, temperate and moist climate as compared with the
interior of continents, from which the tempering influence of the sea
is cut off by mountain chains. Where no such chains intervene the coast
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
climate may extend far inland. The latter case is that of Europe,
where the prevailing westerly winds, warmed by the Gulf Stream, temper
the climate as far east as the borders of Russia, and northward to
Norway; while to southward the warm waters of the Mediterranean and
Black seas temper both heat and cold in Spain, southern France, Italy
and the Mediterranean border generally. But to eastward, in Russia and
Siberia, the climate becomes “continental” to an extreme degree, with
very cold winters and very hot summers. The same is true of interior
North America, wherever the continental divide cuts off the tempering
influence of the westerly winds; Montana, the Dakotas and the Great
Plains states generally being examples. The climate of the Mississippi
valley, as stated before, is tempered by the winds blowing from the
Gulf of Mexico, but with occasional irruptions of the continental
climate (sometimes reaching as far east as the South Atlantic coast)
in the forms of cold “blizzards,” from which the coast climates of
the Pacific and of western Europe are practically free. The Atlantic
coast of North America (including the coast of the Gulf of Mexico),
moreover, not unfrequently suffers from the violent cyclonic storms
that originate in the Antilles and follow more or less the direction of
the Gulf Stream.</p>

<p>Islands, differing from continents mainly in their extent, and having
a relatively large proportion of coast, naturally have climates
controlled essentially by the surrounding ocean. The insular or oceanic
climates are therefore, as a rule, more temperate and even than are
those of the nearest mainland. It is often said that the climate of
western Europe is “insular”; and owing to its position under the lee of
the Gulf Stream, this is eminently true of Great Britain.</p>

<p><i>Subtropic Arid Belts.</i>—Where the surface features of the
land in relation to the ocean and prevailing winds do not interpose
special obstacles, we find to poleward of both tropics a climatic
belt of greater or less width, in which the annual, or at least the
summer rainfall is too small to maintain annual herbaceous vegetation
throughout the season, even when the temperature is favorable. These
two “arid” belts are best defined in Africa, where the northern one is
represented by the Sahara desert, lower Egypt and Arabia, while the
southern one is exemplified in the Kalahari desert, to northward of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
Cape of Good Hope. The northern belt is continued into Asia Minor,
Palestine, Syria and Persia, and is again manifest in northwestern
India; but to eastward is stopped by the influence of the great
Himalaya range. The plateau countries beyond, in Central Asia, are
extremely arid, largely by reason of their high elevation.</p>

<p>In Australia the southern arid belt is very strongly defined. In North
America, the arid belt is characteristically defined on the Pacific
Coast. It embraces all but the southernmost point of the peninsula of
Lower California, with about two-thirds of the State of California;
thence eastward across Sonora and Arizona to New Mexico and western
Texas. But here the influence of the mountain ranges and high plateaus
obscures the subtropical belt as such, the arid climate continuing,
east of the great Pacific ranges, through Nevada, Utah, Wyoming,
Montana, Idaho, and eastern Oregon and Washington nearly to the line of
British Columbia on the north, and with gradually decreasing aridity,
into Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, and the Dakotas.</p>

<p>In South America the rainless seaward slopes of southern Peru and
northern Chile indicate the southern arid belt; but here, the great
chain of the Andes intervening, the dry pampas of Argentina, and the
Gran Chaco of southwestern Brazil, like the Nevada basin, though arid
would naturally be referred to the moisture-condensing influence of
the Andes chain, under the lee of which they lie. From this cause
the region of deficient rainfall, which on the western coast ends to
northward of Santiago de Chile, is east of the Andes continued much
farther poleward, as in North America; reaching into Patagonia.</p>

<p><i>Utilization of the Arid Belts.</i>—While, as already explained, the
distribution of the rainfall through the year is nearly as important
as its total amount, yet it is evident that even with the minimum
of twenty inches of total precipitation as the measure for crop
production, a very large proportion of the land of the arid region
cannot, even with the most elaborate system of water conservation,
be supplied with sufficient water for ordinary crops, and must be
otherwise utilized, mainly for pasture purposes. This is rendered
practicable to a much greater extent than might be expected, because
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
the rapid transition from the rainy to the permanent dry season cures
the standing herbage into hay, which affords good grazing during the
rainless season. Moreover, the use of drought-resistant, browsing
forage plants, both shrubs and trees, serves to supplement materially
any deficiency in the supply of “standing hay,” especially in case the
rains should toward the end be unduly delayed. The same is true of
the dried pods and seeds of native herbage, which in some cases (bur
clover, lupins, etc.,) afford highly nutritious additions to the leafy
forage.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle">RELATIONS OF SOILS AND PLANT<br> GROWTH TO HEAT.</span></h3>
</div>

<p><i>The Temperature of Soils.</i>—The rapid germination of seeds, as
well as the development of plants to maturity, is essentially dependent
upon the maintenance of the appropriate temperature. The temperature
most favorable to germination or growth, as well as the degree of
tolerance of high and low temperatures, varies greatly with different
plants, governing mainly what is known as their climatic adaptation.
A knowledge of these points with reference to the several crops is
therefore of no mean importance to the farmer; for, to a certain
extent, he can control the temperature in the soil itself, and he can
mostly choose for sowing and planting, the time when the soil shall
have the proper temperature for rapid germination or maturity. As a
rule, it is not desirable to have either seeds or seedling plants in
the ground for any length of time when the temperature is too low for
active vegetation; for while they rest, other, lower organisms (fungi
and bacteria), adapted to low temperatures, may continue in full
activity at the expense of the vitality of the crop plant.</p>

<p><i>Water exerts controlling Influence.</i>—Since the capacity of water
for heat is approximately five times greater than that of the average
soil, equal weights being considered, it follows that the temperature
of soil-water must exert a controlling influence over that of the
soil. Taking the case of a cubic foot of loamy soil, fully saturated
with water, in which one-third of the volume may be assumed to be
water: the weight of the dry soil being about eighty pounds per cubic
foot, calculation shows that the amount of heat required to raise the
temperature of the water contained, one degree, will be fully twice as
great as for that required for the soil itself. It is thus obvious that
the control of soil-temperature is largely dependent upon the control
of the water-content of the same, which has been discussed in a former
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
chapter. Even in the condition of moisture known to be most favorable
to plants, viz., one-half of the maximum water capacity, the influence
of the water-content upon the temperature will still be as great
as that of the entire soil mass. This consideration emphasizes the
importance of such control.</p>

<p><i>Cold and Warm Rains.</i>—It is not surprising then that the
occurrence of cold or warm rains or the use of cold or warm irrigation
water at critical periods, may largely determine the success or failure
of the crop. It is well known that the occurrence of a cold rain after
vegetation has started actively in early spring, may not only destroy
the season’s fruit crop by preventing the setting, or thereafter
causing the dropping, of the fruit, but may even, if the suppression
of vegetative action be continued for some length of time, result
in serious injury to, or death of trees. Widely extended disastrous
experience of the kind was had in California in February and March,
1887, resulting in the death of tens of thousands of fruit trees and
vines during that and the following season. It is obvious that in
such a case as this the rapid draining-off of the cold water through
underdrains would have materially mitigated, if not wholly prevented,
such injury.</p>

<p><i>Solar Radiation.</i>—Aside, however, from such overwhelming
influences as the above, the soil temperatures are measurably
controlled by the extent to which they receive and absorb the sun’s
heat rays, whether directly or through the mediation of the air. The
direct effect of the sun’s rays upon the surface is, upon the whole,
the most generally potent, although warm winds may occasionally exert
a very strong influence. The varying influence of the sun’s rays
depends primarily upon the change of seasons, which themselves result
from the varying angles at which the sun’s rays strike the surface; as
well as upon the duration of the day. The greater or less cloudiness
or fogginess of the sky, of course, exerts a decided effect in this
connection.</p>

<p><i>The Penetration of the Sun’s Heat into the Soil.</i>—In the
temperate regions of the earth the daily variations of temperature
cease to be felt at depths ranging from two to three feet, according
to the nature of the soil material and its more or less compacted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
condition. The monthly variations, of course, reach to greater depths;
while the annual variations do not disappear in the temperate zone,
<i>e. g.</i>, at Paris, Zürich and Brussels, at a less depth than
seventy-five feet. At these depths of constant temperature we find
approximately the same temperature as that which we can deduce from
the thermometric observations as the annual mean. From similar causes
the mean annual temperature of any place may be approximately deduced
from the observation of the water of wells and springs derived from
moderate depths. For below the level of constant annual temperature the
latter begins to ascend steadily as we progress downward, owing to the
interior heat of the earth.</p>

<p><i>Change of Temperature with Depth.</i>—The following table of
observations made at Brussels illustrates the decrease of annual range
of temperature with depth:</p>

<table class="spb1">

<p>It is interesting to compare with this record that of a well sunk by
Ermann at Yakutzk, Siberia, where the mean annual temperature is—9.7
C. (14.6 F.). This temperature was found a few feet below the surface.
At 50 feet the temperature was—7.2 C. (19° F.); at 145 feet—5° Cent.
(23° F.) at 350 feet—.9° C. (30.8° F.) showing that the ground was
below the temperature of freezing water for some distance farther down;
so that the search for liquid water was abandoned.</p>

<p>We thus see that in the Arctic regions, owing to the presence of water
in the form of ice, the melting of which impedes the access of solar
heat, the level of no variation is found at the distance of a few feet
below the surface, despite the great variations in temperature between
the short but hot summer and the extremely cold winter. In the tropics,
also, the annual temperature-variation disappears at a less depth than
2 feet, in consequence of the very slight difference between the two
seasonal extremes of temperature.</p>

<p><i>Surface—Conditions that influence Soil-Temperature.</i> Among these,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
<i>color</i> has already been mentioned, and to a certain extent
discussed. While it is true that, broadly speaking, dark-colored soils
absorb more of the sun’s heat than light-colored ones, other things
being equal, it must still be understood, that the nature of the
color-giving substance exerts a very material influence upon the amount
of heat absorbed. Thus charcoal is among all known substances the one
absorbing and radiating the sun’s heat rays most powerfully, and all
kinds alike; so much so, that its absorbent power is taken as 100. But
other substances which to the eye appear equally black, have by no
means the same absorbing power. The heat absorption by black humus is
high, though not quite equal to that of charcoal; and many gray soils,
though appearing to the eye of rather light tint, really absorb more
heat than others which, to our perception, have the darker tint, but
are colored by other substances. Gardeners and especially vine growers
in the colder portions of Europe often take advantage of the powerful
absorbing power of carbon by spreading charcoal or black slate powder
over the surface of the soil where early maturity is specially desired;
and slate powder is similarly used by the peasants at Chamouni to
hasten the melting of the snow.</p>

<p><i>Heat of High and Low Intensity.</i>—It must also be kept in view
that the surfaces, and especially the colors that favor absorption of
the intense rays of the sun, may comport themselves quite differently
toward heat rays of low intensity, such as those thrown back from the
soil at night when it cools. Were this otherwise, a soil that absorbs
much heat in the daytime would lose it with corresponding rapidity at
night. But this is true only of charcoal; in the case of most other
substances, there is a material difference in favor of the retention of
the heat, of low intensity, by slower radiation into a “heat-trapping”
atmosphere.</p>

<p><i>Reflection vs. Dispersion of Heat.</i>—Theoretically, a smooth
surface reflects more heat than a rough one, and warms much more
slowly by absorption; as is strikingly shown by the use of polished
metal screens placed on walls to prevent their being overheated by a
flue near by. In the case of soils, also, the condition of the surface
affects materially the absorption of heat, but not in accordance with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
the above rule so far as the result is concerned. For it is found that,
other things being equal, a loose or cloddy surface disperses in many
directions the heat it receives, and does not permit it to penetrate
by conduction to so great extent as would a more compact soil, whose
smooth surface would waste less of the heat received by radiation.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">King has called special attention to the
difference of temperature existing between soils smoothed and compacted
by a roller, and the unrolled soil having a loose surface. He found
that the former at a depth of one and a half inches was as much as
5.5°C. (10°F.) warmer than the loose soil, and that even at a depth of
three inches a difference as high as 3.5°C. (6.5°F.) existed between
the two. He observed at the same time that the temperature of the air
over the unrolled ground was considerably warmer than above the rolled,
thus corroborating the differences observed in the soil itself. But
at night the heat is given out more rapidly from the rolled than from
the unrolled surface, the latter acting as a non-conductor and keeping
the soil warmer than that of the more compact rolled land. King gives
as the average difference observed between rolled and unrolled land
on eight Wisconsin farms, 1.6°C. (3°F.) in favor of the rolled land
between 1 and 4 p.m.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that the loose tilled layer, while impeding the
penetration of the sun’s heat into the deeper portions of the soil
during the day, on the other hand serves to retain it at night better
than a more compact soil. This obviously places it within the power of
the farmer to exert considerable control over the soil-temperature at
critical times; restraining or favoring the access of the sun’s heat in
accordance with the requirements of the climate or season, as the case
may be.</p>

<p><i>Influence of a Covering of Vegetation, and of Mulches.</i>—A cover
of either living or dead vegetation depresses the temperature of the
soil as compared with the bare land, as elaborately shown by Wollny
and Ebermeyer. In the monthly averages these differences rarely exceed
.8° C. (1.5 degrees F.), and are mostly below .50° C. (1° F.), but
during different parts of the day they may rise to 2.2 to 2.5° C. (4 to
4.5° F.), at 4 inches depth. In summer they are greater than at other
seasons. Of course the density of the vegetation or the thickness of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>
the mulch influences them materially. Forests exert the greatest
cooling influence upon the soil, and next to these the dense herbaceous
crops, such as clover, and the legumes generally.</p>

<p><i>Influence of the Nature of the Soil-Material.</i>—Aside from the
surface condition, the nature of the material itself exerts a certain
influence, not only upon the rate of introduction of heat, but also
upon the amount taken up. Thus quartz sand having the highest density
(greatest weight per cubic foot) and also the highest capacity for
heat among the usual mineral soil-ingredients, will, mass for mass,
experience a smaller rise of temperature than would clay or loam soil,
of less density or volume-weight, and also of lower heat-capacity.
While this holds good theoretically, differences corresponding to
this consideration rarely occur in nature, for the reason that the
much greater influence of the mechanical condition of the soil mostly
overbalances these effects. Thus Wollny has shown that while quartz
is a better heat-conductor than clay, quartz cobbles or gravel will
materially increase the temperature of the soil in which they are
imbedded. Yet compact clay is a better conductor of heat than loose
sand; hence the latter, when exposed to the intense heat of the summer
sun in the desert, becomes intensely hot on the surface, yet allows of
the existence of abundant moisture at a depth of ten or twelve inches;
while clay in the same region, being usually in a compacted condition,
will show a lower surface-temperature and will be warmer and drier
at a depth at which sand will still retain abundant moisture, and be
comparatively cool (<a href="#Page_257">See chap. 13, p. 257</a>.) So much
indeed depends upon the state of mechanical division and flocculation in which
the several soils may happen to be, that a hard-and-fast statement in regard to
their relations to heat cannot and should not be given, as it would
only lead to disappointments and practical mistakes; the more as in all
cases the moisture-condition exerts an influence predominating by far
over that of the dry material itself, and this moisture-condition is
subject to rapid changes, owing to intrinsic differences in the several
classes of soils. Wollny states as the result of his experiments, that
in summer sandy soils are warmest; then humous, lime and loam soils;
while in winter humous soils are warmest, then loams; and sand coldest.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span></p>

<p><i>Influence of Evaporation.</i>—In treating of the Conservation of
Soil Moisture (<a href="#Page_234">chapter 13</a>), the effects, conditions and
control of evaporation from the soil have already been discussed from several
points of view; so that a summary review of the subject must suffice in
this place.</p>

<p>It has been stated above that in the case of an average loam soil
saturated with water, the heat required to raise the temperature of
the water one degree would be about twice that needed to so change the
dry soil material itself. But if it is required to <i>evaporate</i>
the same amount of water from the soil, nearly ten (9.667) times that
amount of heat will be required; or in the case assumed, twenty times
as much as would suffice to raise the temperature of the dry soil
through an equal interval of temperature. While in a few cases the
cooling of the soil by evaporation is desirable, in the vast majority
of cases it is injurious to the progress of vegetation, and should
be restricted as much as possible by the means outlined in a former
chapter.</p>

<p><i>Formation of Dew.</i>—There is, however, another aspect of
evaporation from the soil which has been long misunderstood, although
the true state of the case was partially recognized long ago. Dew
is in common parlance said to “fall,” it being supposed that, like
rain, it is derived from the atmosphere. While this is partially
true, inasmuch as from very moist, and notably from foggy air dew is
frequently deposited on grass and foliage generally, as well as on wood
and other strongly heat-radiating surfaces; yet as a matter of fact,
in by far the majority of cases, as shown by H. E. Stockbridge<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>
and confirmed by everyday observation, dew is formed from the vapor rising
from the warmer soil into a colder atmosphere, and condensed on the
most strongly heat-radiating surfaces near the ground, such as grass,
leaves both green and dry, wood, and other objects first encountering
the rising vapor. In manifest proof of this it will be noted that very
heavy dews may be seen on the ground, when the roofs of houses as well
as the higher shrubs and trees remain perfectly dry. In winter this
may be most strikingly seen in the deposition of hoar-frost in and immediately
around the cracks of plank sidewalks, whose surface remains dry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>
<i>Dew rarely adds Moisture.</i>—Candid observations will convince
any one, therefore, that in most cases the supposed addition to the
moisture of the soil from dews is an illusion. Whatever dewdrops fall
on the ground are in general simply the return to the soil of a part
of what came from it; while the dew that evaporates from the bedewed
leaves or other objects represents simply a delayed outgo of moisture
from the soil, which for a time retards evaporation direct from the
soil, and thus effects a slight saving of moisture.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">But while this is measurably true of inland
and especially of continental areas like the great plains of North and
South America, it is also true that in deep moist valleys, and on the
rainy and foggy coast regions of continents, dews are found to both
fall and rise, not uncommonly to such an extent as to be equivalent
to a not inconsiderable aggregate precipitation. Thus in the moist
coast belt of Oregon and Washington lying west of the Cascade range of
mountains, the morning dews of summer are frequently so copious that
the water falls in showers from the lower trees and shrubs, so as to
necessitate the use of water-proof clothing when traversing the woods
in the morning, quite as much as though rain was actually falling.
In hilly and more especially in mountainous regions the cold air
descending from above and flowing down in the ravines will often cause
a heavy condensation of dew in these, while the bordering ridges, which
rise above the cold currents, remain free from dew. These descending
currents as a rule not only bring no surplus moisture with them, but
in their downward course become warmer by contraction and therefore
relatively drier. In these cases also, therefore, the dew is purely
moisture derived from the ground, which in rising encounters the cold
air and is thus condensed.</p>

<p>The fact that dew is most commonly derived from the soil could have
been foreseen from the other fact, long ascertained and known, that
during the night the soil is as a rule warmer than the air above it; as
has been shown by the earlier observers, as well as more specifically
by Stockbridge.</p>

<p><i>Dew within the Soil.</i>—It is obvious that whenever dew is formed
above the surface of the soil, the air within the latter must be at or
near its point of saturation with vapor, as in fact is usually the case
a few inches below the surface. It follows that when a depression of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>
temperature occurs within the soil, <i>e. g.</i>, at night, dew must
be deposited within the soil down to the depth to which the nightly
variation reaches, increasing at that depth as the vapor from the
warmer soil below rises, to be in its turn condensed. There is thus
formed at that level a zone of greater moisture, which may sometimes
be noted in digging pits, by a deeper tint, without any corresponding
variation in the nature of the soil. The daily repetition of this
process, at varying depths, and its greater or less recurrence at or
near the limit-levels of monthly and even annual variations, must
exert a not inconsiderable influence upon the vertical distribution
of moisture in the soil; which instead of being usually found in
horizontal bands or zones of varying moisture-contents, is usually
remarkably uniform for considerable depths, despite the fitfully
recurrent additions from rains. It is at least probable that this
process of dew-formation within the soil materially assists capillarity
in effecting a measurably uniform vertical distribution of moisture.
(<a href="#Page_207">See also page 207, chapter 11</a>).</p>

<p><i>Plant-development under different Temperature Conditions.</i>—In
the arctic regions the ground, frozen in winter to unknown depths, may
thaw to only three to five feet during the summer, notwithstanding
the great length and continuous sunshine of the arctic day. The
shallow-rooted arctic flora develops very rapidly under the influence
of the continuous daylight and heat, in the course of from five to
eight weeks. The seeds of these plants must, of course, be capable of
germinating at very low temperatures; and as a matter of fact, we find
that both in the arctic regions and in the higher mountains, certain
plants are found growing and blooming on slopes flecked with snow; each
plant surrounded by a small circle of bare ground, where the snow has
been melted under the influence of the dark-tinted earth and leaves.
It is clear that here germination has occurred, the foliage has been
formed, and the roots have been exercising their vegetable functions,
in ground soaked with water practically ice-cold.</p>

<p><i>Germination of Seeds.</i>—While wild plants of special adaptation
may thrive in very low (or high) temperatures, it is also true that few
of our cultivated plants will germinate, and still less grow thriftily,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>
at such low temperatures. The limit below which most cultivated plants
may be considered as remaining practically inactive lies between
4.4 and 7.2° C. (40 and 45° F.). Few tropical plants will germinate
much below 23.8° (75° F.) and in some cases not below 35° Cent. (95°
F.). Even maize and pumpkins, according to Haberlandt, germinate
most rapidly between 35 and 38.3° C. (95 and 101° F.), while for
wheat, rye, oats and flax the best temperature for germination lies
between 21.1 to 26.1 (70 to 79°). Under the most favorable conditions
of temperature and moisture, some small seeds which readily absorb
moisture will germinate in from twenty-four to forty-eight hours, while
at a lower temperature they may require from three days to two weeks.
Thus Haberlandt found that while oats would germinate in two days at
a temperature of 17.2 to 17.5° C. (63° to 63.5°), it took a full week
for germination when the temperature was only 5° C. (41° F.). It is
obvious that seeds remaining inert in the soil for such lengths of time
will be subject to a variety of vicissitudes that may injure or destroy
their vitality. There are many bacteria and fungous parasites which at
low temperatures are perfectly capable of attacking and destroying the
water-soaked seed. There is thus for each plant, from the lowest to the
highest, a certain temperature most favorable to development; and both
above and below this, the vegetative activity is seriously interfered
with or wholly checked. A knowledge of these limits is manifestly of
the utmost practical importance.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">The influence of too high a temperature in
preventing the germination of cinchona seed from India, was curiously
exemplified when it was subjected to a supposedly favorable steady
temperature of 23.8° C. (75° F.) under otherwise most favorable
conditions. Not a single one came up in the course of six weeks, and
the box in which it had been sown was put away outside of the hothouse
as a failure. Within two weeks a full stand of seedlings was obtained,
at temperatures ranging between 12.7 and 15.5° C. (55° and 60° F.).
The fact that the cinchona is a tree of the lower slopes of the Andes
(three to five thousand feet) although at home strictly within the
tropics, explains the apparent anomaly.</p>

<span class="h_subtitle">THE PHYSICO-CHEMICAL INVESTIGATION OF<br>
SOILS IN RELATION TO CROP PRODUCTION.</span></h3>
</div>

<p>The chemical constituents of soils have been incidentally mentioned
and discussed above, both in connection with the processes of
soil-formation, and with the minerals that mainly participate therein.
The manner of their occurrence and their relations to plant life, so
far as known, must now be considered more in detail.</p>

<h4>HISTORICAL REVIEW OF SOIL<br> INVESTIGATION.</h4>

<p>While the obvious importance of the physical soil-conditions has long
ago rendered them subjects of close study by Schübler<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>
Boussingault and others, the chemistry of soils was very generally
neglected for a considerable period, after the hopes at first
entertained by Liebig that chemical analysis would furnish a
direct indication and measure of soil fertility, had been sorely
disappointed in respect to the only soils then investigated, viz.,
the long-cultivated ones of Europe. The results of chemical analysis
sometimes agreed, but as often pointedly disagreed, with cultural
experiences; so that after the middle of the nineteenth century, but
few thought it worth while to occupy their time in chemical soil analysis.</p>

<p><i>Popular Forecasts of Soil Values.</i>—In newly-settled countries,
and still more in those yet to be settled, the questions of the
immediate productive capacity, and the future durability of the virgin
land are the burning ones, since they determine the future of thousands
for weal or woe. This need has long ago led to approximate estimates
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>
made on the part of the settler, by the <i>observation of the native
growth, especially the tree growth</i>; and where this consists of
familiar species, normally developed, such estimates on the part of
experienced men, based on previous cultural experience, are generally
very accurate; so much so that in many of the newer states they have
been adopted in determining not only the market value, but also the tax
rate upon such lands, their productiveness, and probable durability
being a matter of common note.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">Thus in the long-leaf pine uplands of the
Cotton States, the scattered settlements have fully demonstrated that
after two or three years cropping with corn, ranging from as much
as 25 bushels per acre the first year to ten and less the third,
fertilization is absolutely necessary to farther paying cultivation.
Should the short-leaved pine mingle with the long-leaved, production
may hold out for from five to seven years. If oaks and hickory are
superadded, as many as twelve years of good production without
fertilization may be looked for by the farmer; and should the
long-leaved pine disappear altogether, the mingled growth of oaks and
short-leaved pine will encourage him to hope for from twelve to fifteen
years of fair production without fertilization. </p>

<p>Corresponding estimates based upon the tree growth and in part also
upon minor vegetation, are current in the richer lands also. The
“black-oak and hickory uplands,” the “post-oak flats,” “hickory
bottoms,” “gum bottoms,” “hackberry hammocks,” “post-oak prairie,”
“red-cedar prairie,” and scores of other similar designations, possess
a very definite meaning in the minds of farmers and are constantly used
as a trustworthy basis for bargain and sale, and for crop estimates.
Moreover, experienced men will even after many years’ cultivation be
able to distinguish these various kinds of lands from one another.</p>

<p><i>Cogency of Conclusions based upon Native Growth.</i>—Since the
native vegetation normally represents the results of secular or even
millennial adaptation of plants to climatic and soil-conditions, this
use of the native flora seems eminently rational. Moreover, it is
obvious that if we were able to interpret correctly the meaning of such
vegetation with respect not only to cultural conditions and crops, but
also as regards the exact physical and chemical nature of the soil, so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>
as to recognize the <i>causes</i> of the observed vegetative
preferences; we should be enabled to project that recognition into
those cases where native vegetation is not present to serve as a guide;
and we might thus render the physical and chemical examination of
soils as useful practically, <i>everywhere</i>, as is, locally, the
observation of the native growths. To a certain extent, such knowledge
would be useful in determining the salient characters of cultivated
soils, also; and would be the more useful and definite in its practical
indications the more nearly the cultural history of the land is known,
and the less the latter has been changed by fertilization. For, so soon
as the first flush of production has passed, the question of how to
fertilize most effectually and cheaply demands solution.</p>

<p>It was from this standpoint, suggested by his early experience in the
Middle West and subsequently most impressively presented to him in the
prosecution of the geological and agricultural survey of Mississippi,
that the writer originally undertook, in 1857, the detailed study of
the physical characters and chemical composition of soils. It seemed
to him incredible that the well-defined and practically so important
distinctions based on natural vegetation, everywhere recognized and
continually acted upon by farmers and settlers, should not be traceable
to definite physical and chemical differences in the respective lands,
by competent, comprehensively-trained scientific observers, whose field
of vision should be broad enough to embrace concurrently the several
points of view—geological, physical, chemical and botanical—that
must be conjointly considered in forming one’s judgment of land. Such
trained observers should not merely do as well as the “untutored
farmer,” but a great deal better.</p>

<p><i>“Ecological” studies.</i>—Yet thus far we vainly seek in general
agricultural literature for any systematic or consistent studies of
these relations. We do find “ecological” lists of trees and other
plants, or “plant associations,” growing in certain regions or land
areas, described in some of the general terms which may refer equally
well to lands of profuse productiveness, or to such as will hardly
pay for taxes when cultivated. Or when the productive value is
mentioned, the probable cause of such value is barely alluded to, even
conjecturally, unless it be in describing the “plant formations” as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>
xerophytic, mesophytic or hydrophytic, upon the arbitrary assumption
that moisture is the only governing factor; wholly ignoring such
vitally important factors as the physical texture of the soil, its
depth, the nature of the substrata, and the (oftentimes abundantly
obvious) predominant chemical nature of the land. And on the other
hand, we find even public surveys proceeding upon the basis of physical
data alone, practically ignoring the botanical and chemical point of
view, and inferentially denying, or at least ignoring, their relevancy
to the practical problems of the farm.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p><i>Early Soil Surveys of Kentucky, Arkansas and Mississippi.</i>—Among
the few who during the middle of the past century maintained their
belief in the possibility of practically useful results from direct
soil investigation, were Drs. David Dale Owen and Robert Peter, who
prosecuted such work extensively in connection with the geological and
agricultural surveys of Kentucky and Arkansas; and the writer, who
carried out similar work in the states of Mississippi and Louisiana,
with results in many respects so definite that he has ever since
regarded this as a most fruitful study, and has later continued it in
California and the Pacific Northwest. This was done in the face of
almost uniform discouragement from agricultural chemists until within
the last two decades; with occasional severe criticisms of this work as
a waste of labor and of public funds.</p>

<p><i>Investigation of Cultivated Soils.</i>—All this opposition was
largely due to the prejudices engendered by the futile attempts to
deduce practically useful results from the chemical analysis of
<i>soils long cultivated</i>, without first studying the less complex
phenomena of <i>virgin</i> soils; and these prejudices persisted
longest in the United States, even though in Europe the reaction
against the hasty rejection of chemical soil work had begun some time
before; as is evidenced by the methods employed at the Rothamsted
Experimental Farm in England, the Agricultural College of France, the
Russian agronomic surveys, and at several points in Germany. In none of
these cases, however, more than the purely chemical or physico-chemical
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>
standpoint was assumed; although in Russia at least, virgin soils were
easily obtainable and their native growth verifiable; and were actually
in part made the subject of chemical investigation.</p>

<p>In the course of their work, Owen and Peter always carefully recorded
the native vegetation of the soils collected; but neither seems to
have formulated definitely the idea that such vegetation might be made
the basis of direct correlation of soil-composition with cultural
experience. Owen repeatedly expressed to the writer his conviction that
such a correlation could be definitely established by close study; but
early death prevented his personal elaboration of the results of his
work. Peter likewise stoutly maintained to the last his conviction that
soil analysis was the key to the forecasting of cultural possibilities;
but not being a botanist he did not see his way to put such forecasts
into definite form.</p>

<h4><i>Change of Views.</i></h4>

<p>In the United States as well, the ancient prejudices have now gradually
given way before the urgent call for more definite information than
could otherwise possibly be given to farmers by the experiment
stations, most of whose cultural experiments, made without any definite
knowledge of the nature of the soil under trial, were found to be
of little value outside of their own experimental fields. Even the
multiplication of culture stations in several states, unaccompanied
by soil research, is found to be a delusive repetition of the same
inconclusive, random experimenting, since it takes into consideration
only the climatic differences, but leaves out of consideration the
potent factors of soil quality and soil variations. At most these were
usually mentioned by them in such indefinite terms as “a clay loam,”
“a coarse sandy soil,” “gray sediment land,” and the like; frequently
not even with a statement of the depth and character of the subsoil and
substrata, much less of their geological derivation or correlations.
Thus any one not happening to be personally acquainted with the land in
question would be wholly without definite data to correlate the results
with his own case. It is quite obvious that even if only to make
possible the identification of new lands with others that have already
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>
fallen under cultural experience, and can therefore afford useful
indications to the new settler, a close physical and chemical
characterization of lands should be made the special object of study by
the experiment stations and public surveys, particularly in the newer states.</p>

<p><i>Advantages for Soil Study offered by Virgin Lands.</i>—Among the
special advantages, then, offered by virgin soils for the study of the
correlations of soils and crops, the usual existence of a native flora,
representing the results of secular adaptation, is of fundamental
importance. As it is at this time still historically known of most
lands west of the Alleghenies what was their original timber growth,
it is clear that their original condition can still be ascertained
by comparison with uncultivated lands of similar growth, usually not
very far away; and as their cultural history also is largely within
the memory of the living generation, the behavior of such lands under
cultivation is known or verifiable. Foremost among the data thus
ascertainable is the <i>duration of satisfactory crop production, and
its average amount</i>. To ascertain these surviving data by inquiry
among the farming population should be among the foremost duties of
those connected with soil surveys; and persons temperamentally unable
to enlist the farmer’s sympathy and interest in such inquiries must
be considered seriously handicapped, no matter what their scientific
qualifications may be. In no quest is it more literally true that there
is no one from whom the earnest inquirer may not learn something worth
knowing.</p>

<p><i>Practical Utility of Chemical Soil-Analysis; Permanent Value</i> vs.
<i>Immediate Productiveness</i>.—In many existing treatises so much
emphasis is given to the alleged proofs of the inutility of chemical
soil examination in particular, that a special controversion of these
arguments seems necessary, in connection with a detailed statement
of what can, and in part has been, done in that direction. Hence the
often-repeated allusion, in the sequel, to points bearing on this
question. Hence, also, the detailed discussion of many points which in
most agricultural publications are given only passing notice.</p>

<p><i>In all these discussions the difference between</i> the
ascertainment of the <i>permanent-productive value of soils</i>, as
against that of their <i>immediate producing capacity</i>, must be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>
strictly kept in view. The former interests vitally the permanent
settler or farmer; the latter concerns the immediate outlook for crop
production, the “Düngerzustand” of the Germans. The methods for the
ascertainment of these two factors are wholly distinct, even though the
results and their causes are in most cases intimately correlated. The
failure to observe this distinction accounts for a great deal of the
obloquy and reproach that has in the past so often been heaped upon
chemical soil-analysis and its advocates.</p>

<h4>PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL CONDITIONS<br> OF PLANT GROWTH.</h4>

<p>While it is true that plants cannot form their substance or develop
healthy growth in the absence or scarcity of the chemical ingredients
mentioned on page xxxi of this volume, it is also true that they cannot
use these unless the physical conditions of normal vegetation are first
fulfilled. Both sets of conditions are intrinsically equally important
and exacting as to their fulfilment; and the farmers’ task is to bring
about this concurrence to the utmost extent possible. The chemical
ingredients of plant-food can, however, be artificially supplied in
the form of fertilizers, should they be deficient in the soil; but as
has been shown in the preceding pages, it is not always possible to
correct, within the limits of farm economy, physical defects existing
in the land. Hence, however important is the natural richness of the
soil in plant-food, <i>the first care should always be given to the
ascertainment of the proper physical conditions in the soil, subsoil
and substrata</i>. Without these, oftentimes, no amount of cultivation,
fertilization and irrigation is effective in assuring profitable
cultural results.</p>

<p><i>Condition of the Plant-food Ingredients in the Soil.</i>—But even
the abundant <i>presence</i> of the plant-food ingredients, as shown
by analysis, will not avail, unless at least an adequate portion of
the same exists in a form or forms accessible to plants. Of course
this condition would seem to be best fulfilled by the ingredients in
question being in the <i>water-soluble</i> condition. But in the first
place, plants are quite sensitive to an over-supply of soluble mineral
salts, as is evidenced by the injurious effects produced by the latter
in saline and alkali lands. Furthermore, substances in that form would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span>
be very liable to be washed or leached out of the soil by heavy rains
or irrigation, and would be lost in the country drainage. It is
therefore clearly desirable that only a relatively small proportion
of the useful soil-ingredients should be in the water-soluble or
physically absorbed condition, but that a larger supply should be
present in forms not so easily soluble, yet accessible to the solvent
action which the acids of the soil and of the roots of plants are
capable of exercising. This <i>virtually</i> available supply we may
designate as the <i>reserve food-store</i>.</p>

<p>Finally, there is practically in all soils a certain proportion of the
<i>soil-minerals in their original form</i>, as they existed in the
rock-materials from which the soil was formed. These minerals being
usually in a more or less finely divided or pulverulent condition, they
are attacked much more rapidly by the chemically-acting “weathering”
agencies, viz., water, oxygen, carbonic and humus acids, than when
in solid masses; and thus, transformation of the inert rock-powder
into the other two classes of mineral soil-ingredients progresses in
naturally fertile soils with sufficient rapidity to produce, in a
single season, sensible and practically important results, known as the
effects of <i>fallowing</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Reserve.</i>—The nature of these processes has been discussed
in chapters 1 to 4; and it will be remembered that two of their
most prominent results are the <i>formation of clay</i>, and of
<i>zeolitic-compounds</i>, the latter being, as heretofore stated
(<a href="#Page_36">pp. 36 ff</a>) hydrous silicates of earths and alkalies,
easily decomposable by acids, and also capable of exchanging part or the whole
of such basic ingredients with solutions of others that may enter the soil.
These zeolitic compounds therefore fulfil two important functions in
the premises, viz.: a ready yielding-up of part of their ingredients
to acid solvents, and a tendency to fix, by exchange, a portion or the
whole of the soluble compounds that may be set free in, or brought
upon the land. The first-mentioned property is of direct avail in that
the soil-humus forms, and the roots of plants exude, acid solvents on
their surface, and can thus draw upon the reserve store of food; the
second tells in the direction of preventing the waste of water-soluble
manurial ingredients supplied to, or formed in the soil. (<a href="#Page_38">See above,
chapter 3, page 38</a>).
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span></p>

<p>The reserve food-store may then be placed under the following heads:</p>

<p><i>Hydrous or “zeolitic” silicates</i>, from which dilute acids can
take up the bases potash, soda, lime and magnesia. These silicates may
be in either the gelatinous or powdery form; in the former case they
may also occlude water-soluble substances.</p>

<p><i>Carbonates of lime and magnesia</i>, which are readily dissolved by
carbonated water as well as by the vegetable acids.</p>

<p><i>Phosphates of lime and magnesia</i>, not very readily soluble in
carbonated water, but more readily attacked by the acids of the soil
and of plant roots; thus supplying phosphoric acid to plants. The more
finely divided they are the more readily they are dissolved; some soils
containing only crystalline needles of apatite (<a href="#Page_63">see chap. 5, p. 63</a>)
only are nevertheless poor in available phosphoric acid.</p>

<p>The natural phosphates of iron and alumina are practically insoluble
in all solvents at the disposal of vegetation and though present in
considerable amounts in some soils, (<a href="#Page_355">see chapter 19, page 355</a>),
may be considered as being permanently inert, and therefore not to be counted
among the soil resources for plant nutrition. As yet no artificial
process by which their phosphoric acid can be made available within the
soil, has been discovered.</p>

<p><i>Water-soluble Ingredients.</i>—As regards these it has already
been explained that they are largely retained in the condition of
purely physical adsorption, as in the case of charcoal or quartz sand,
through which sea water filters and is thereby partially deprived of
its salts. But these can be gradually withdrawn by washing with pure
water alone, and still more easily when stronger solvents are used.
Since the soil-water is always more or less charged with carbonic acid,
and the roots themselves secrete carbonic as well as stronger acids in
their absorption of mineral plant-food, there is no difficulty about
explaining the manner in which such physically condensed ingredients
are taken up.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span>
<i>Recognition of the Prominent Chemical Character of Soils.</i> In a
former chapter the soils formed from the several minerals and rocks
have been discussed in a general manner. We can as a rule obtain some
insight into the nature of any soil which we can trace to its parent
rock or rocks, if we are acquainted with the composition of the latter.</p>

<p>Similarly, but in a much more direct manner, we can obtain a
strong presumption as to the nature of any soil by determining the
undecomposed minerals present in it. In all ordinary cases the
presumption must be that the decomposed portion of the soil has been
derived from the minerals still found in it. Of course it may happen
in the case of lands derived from widely distinct and distant regions
that no such characteristic minerals can be found; this is very
commonly true of the soils forming the deltas of large rivers, in
which sometimes the only remaining recognizable mineral is quartz in
its several forms, with occasional grains of such hardy minerals as
tourmaline, garnet, etc. Apart from such cases, the hand lens or the
microscope permits us to recognize in most soils the minerals that have
mainly contributed to their formation, thus also gaining a clew to
their prominent chemical nature.</p>

<p>Such recognition sometimes involves, of course, a somewhat intimate
knowledge of mineralogy; yet a little practice will enable almost
any one to identify the more important soil-forming minerals, under
the lens or microscope, according to the degree of abrasion or
decomposition they may have undergone. The details of such researches
lie outside of the limits of this treatise, but some general directions
on the subject are given farther on.<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p><i>Acidity, Neutrality, Alkalinity.</i>—A test never to be omitted is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span>
that of the reaction of the soil on litmus or other test paper, to
ascertain its acid, neutral or alkaline reaction. Should the latter
occur quickly (by the prompt blueing of red litmus paper), “black
alkali” would be indicated; but a blueing after 20 to 30 minutes
means merely that a sufficiency of lime carbonate is present. An acid
reaction (the reddening of blue litmus paper) of course indicates a
“sour” soil (<a href="#Page_122">see chap. 8, page 122</a>).</p>

<p><i>Chemical Analysis of Soils.</i>—When the observations mentioned
above give no very decisive results or inferences as to the soil’s
chemical character, the more elaborate processes of qualitative and
quantitative chemical analysis may be called in. It would seem at first
sight that these ought to yield very definite results to guide the
cultivator; yet such is by no means always the case. Both the previous
history of the land, and the method of analysis, influence materially
the practical utility of the results of chemical soil analysis.</p>

<p>The cause of this uncertainty becomes obvious when we consider the
three groups of ingredients outlined above, viz., the insoluble
or unavailable, wholly <i>undecomposed rock minerals</i>; the
“<i>reserve</i>,” consisting of compounds not soluble in water but
soluble in or decomposable by weak acids; and the <i>water-soluble
portion</i>, either actually dissolved in the water held by the soil,
or held by the soil itself in (physical) absorption. While the latter
portion is directly and immediately available to plants, the amounts
thus held are usually quite small, and (outside of alkali lands) would
rarely suffice for the needs of a crop during a growing season.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>
This demand must be materially supplemented by what can be made available
from the soil minerals and the “reserve” by weathering, conjoined with
the direct action of the acids secreted from the plant’s root-hairs
upon the soil particles to which they are attached. It is obvious
that the greater or less <i>abundance</i> of the plant-food in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span>
soil-material upon which these processes may be brought to bear, must
essentially influence the adequacy of the plant-food thus supplied.
Moreover, the greater or less extent to which these sources may have
been drawn upon previously in the course of cultivation, will similarly
influence that adequacy, on account of the diminution of the readily
available supply.</p>

<p><i>Water-soluble and Acid-soluble Portions most Important.</i>—It
thus seems that while the undecomposed rock minerals are indicative of
the nature of the soil, but not directly concerned in plant nutrition,
the most direct interest attaches to the <i>water-soluble portion</i>,
and the <i>acid-soluble</i> reserve. Both of these can, of course, be
withdrawn from the soil by treatment with acids of greater or less
strength; and it would seem that if we knew just what is the kind
and strength of the acid solvent employed by each plant, we could so
imitate their action as to determine definitely whether or not the soil
contains an adequate or deficient supply of actually available food for
the coming crop.</p>

<p><i>We Cannot Imitate Plant-root Action.</i>—In this, however, we
encounter serious difficulties. The acids secreted by the plant roots
are not the only solvents active in the dissolution of plant-food; as
yet we know the nature of only a few; and even these, instead of acting
for a long time (season) on a relatively small number of soil particles
touched by the root-hairs, can in our laboratories only be allowed to
act for a short time on the entire soil-mass. Clearly, the results
thus obtained cannot be a direct measure of the amount of plant-food
which a plant may take up in a given time; we can only gain comparative
figures. These, however, can be utilized by comparison with actual
cultural experience obtained in similar cases.</p>

<p><i>Cultural experience</i> must, of course, be the final test in all
these questions; and it is generally more fruitful to investigate the
causes underlying such actual practical experience, than to attempt
to supply, artificially, the supposed conditions of plant growth. The
latter are so complex and so difficult of control, that the results
obtained by synthetic, small-scale experiments are constantly liable to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span>
the suspicion that they are partly or wholly due to other causes than
those purposely supplied by the experimenter.</p>

<div class="blockquot fs_90">
<p><i>Analysis of Cultivated Soils.</i>—It is also clear that in view
of the inevitable complexity of the conditions governing vegetable
growth, we should whenever feasible proceed from the more simple to the
more complex. The failure to conform to this rule in soil investigation
has been the cause of an enormous waste of energy and work bestowed,
at the very outset, upon the most complex problem of all, viz., the
investigation of soils long cultivated and manured; lands which, having
been subject perhaps for centuries to a great and wholly indefinite
variety of crops and cultural practices, had thereby become so beset
with artificial conditions that without a previous knowledge of what
constitutes the normal regime in natural soils, the correlation of
their chemical constitution, as ascertainable by our present methods,
with their production under culture, became as complex a problem as
that of motions of three mutually gravitating points in space. Neither
can be solved by the ordinary processes of analysis, chemical or
mathematical. Nevertheless, though it was at one time contended that
the minute proportion of plant-food ingredients withdrawn from soils by
cultivation could not be detected by quantitative analysis, numerous
examples have shown that with our present more delicate methods this
can in most cases be done, though not always after a single year’s
crop.</p>

<p><i>Methods of Soil Analysis.</i>—The more or less incisive solvent
agents used in extracting a soil for analysis will of course produce
results widely at variance with each other. When fusion with carbonate
of soda, or treatment with fluohydric acid is resorted to, we obtain
for each soil-ingredient the sum of all the amounts contained in each
of the three categories—the unchanged minerals, the zeolitic “reserve,”
and the water-soluble portion. It was early recognized that the results
of such analyses bear no intelligible relation to the productive
capacity of soils; for pulverized rocks of many kinds, or volcanic
ashes freshly ejected and notoriously incapable of supporting plant
growth, might be made to give exactly the same composition. The amounts
of plant-food ingredients thus shown might be several hundreds or
thousands of times greater than what one crop would take from the soil,
and yet not an ear of grain could be produced on the material. The only
case in which any useful information could be thus obtained would be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span>
that of the absence, or great scarcity, of one or more of the
plant-food ingredients. </p>

<p>The next step was to use in soil analysis acids of such strength as
to dissolve all the zeolitic (and water-soluble) portion, leaving the
unweathered soil minerals behind; it being assumed that the prolonged
action of the roots and soil-solvents would in the end act similarly to
the acids employed, such as chlorhydric or nitric acids.</p>

<p>But here also the results of analysis very commonly failed to
correspond to cultural experience in the case of <i>cultivated</i>
soils; which frequently failed utterly to produce satisfactory crops
even when the acid-analysis had shown an abundance of plant-food
ingredients. Upon this evidence, this method of soil investigation was
also condemned as being of little or no practical utility; and this has
ever since been a widely prevalent view.</p>
</div>

<p>The preferable investigation of cultivated soils was due to the
fact that they are practically the only ones <i>available</i> in
the countries where the study of agricultural science was then
being prosecuted; and the paucity of useful results there achieved
discouraged the undertaking of similar researches where, as in the
United States, the materials for the investigation of the simpler
cases—those of unchanged, natural or virgin soils—were readily
accessible. It was not apparent on the surface that the indefinitely
varied conditions introduced by long culture would inevitably cause
this lack of definite correlation between the immediate productive
capacity of a soil and the composition of its acid-soluble portion, and
that yet the same might not be true of natural, uncultivated soils,
which have all been subjected, alike, only to the natural processes
of weathering, and to the annual return of nearly the whole of the
ingredients withdrawn by plant growth.</p>

<p>Following the failure of the treatment with strong acids to yield
with cultivated soils results definitely correlated with cultural
experience, numerous attempts were made to gain better indications
by the employment of weaker acid solvents. The pure arbitrariness of
such diluted solvents was equaled by the total indefiniteness and
irrelevance of the results with different soils. Only two rational
alternatives seem to remain, viz., either to push the extraction to the
full extent beyond which action becomes so slow as to clearly exclude
any farther effective action of plant acids; or else to use the latter
themselves at such strengths as by actual experiment is found to exist
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span>
in their root sap. The first alternative aims to ascertain the
<i>permanent productive values</i> of soils; the latter to test their
<i>immediate productive capacity</i>. Both alternatives are purely
empirical, and derive their only claim to practical value from their
accordance with practical experience (<a href="#Page_340">see chapter 19</a>).</p>

<h4>THE SOLVENT ACTION OF WATER<br> UPON SOILS.</h4>

<p>The almost universal solvent power of pure water has already been
alluded to in chapter 2 (<a href="#Page_18">see p. 18</a>), and illustrated by
the analyses of drain and river waters. While these convey a general idea of the
chief substances dissolved and carried off, the direct investigation
of the solutions actually obtainable from the soil by longer treatment
and with no more water than is compatible with the welfare of ordinary
crops, necessarily gives somewhat different results. For when drains
flow during or after heavy rains the water has not time to become
saturated. The following data afford a clearer insight into the actual
and possible solvent effects of water in the soil, and its possible
adequacy to plant nutrition unaided by acid solvents.</p>

<p><i>Extraction of Soils with Pure Water.</i>—Eichhorn and Wunder
treated soils from Bonn, and from Chemnitz (Saxony) respectively for
ten days and four weeks with about one-third of their weight of water;
the solutions thus obtained contain in 1,000,000 parts:</p>

These figures differ widely in most respects from those given for drain
and river waters. Potash especially is far more abundantly present in
the Bonn-soil solution than in the drain water, and so is phosphoric
acid; while lime is not widely different. Eichhorn therefore calculates
that with a reasonably adequate supply of water, these ingredients
would fully suffice for a full crop of wheat. The Chemnitz soil, on the
other hand, does not yield enough plant-food for more than a very small
crop upon the same assumptions.</p>

<p><i>Continuous Solubility of Soil-ingredients.</i>—It seems to be
impossible to exhaust a soil’s solubility by repeated or continuous
leaching with water. This was demonstrated in 1863 and 1864 by
Ulbricht<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>
and by Schultze;<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>
their general conclusions have quite lately been corroborated by King,<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>
as the result of extended and very careful investigations.</p>

<p>Schultze experimented on a rich soil from Mecklenburg, by
continuous leaching with distilled water for six days, one liter
passing every twenty-four hours, with the following results.</p>

<p>It thus appears that while the first extraction removed the main
portion of the organic matter, the inorganic matters dissolved were not
greatly diminished in subsequent leachings; and that phosphoric acid
continued to come off to the last. The rich soil used in this case gave
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span>
results corresponding in general to these from the Bonn soil, in the
previous table. From a poorer soil similarly treated by Ulbricht,
described by him as a ferruginous sand from Dahme, the leaching of
which was continued for thirty days in periods of three days each, with
a total of forty times its weight of water, the results were as follows:</p>

<p>It will be seen that there is a considerable difference both in the
total amounts of matters dissolved and in the phosphoric acid taken out

uniformity of the amounts of potash removed at the successive leachings
is remarkable.</p>

<p><i>King’s Results.</i>—The same general features are again strikingly
illustrated by King’s results, as given in the following table. King’s
first leachings were always made by shaking up the soil with ten times
its dry weight of water for three minutes, then after subsidence
filtering the solutions through a Chamberland (porcelain biscuit)
filter, and then (without evaporation) determining the ingredients
dissolved, by very delicate, mostly colorimetric methods. Subsequent
leachings were made by packing the soil around the filters and washing
with five times the weight of water, taking about fifteen minutes each
time; but drying the soil at 120 degrees C. between successive leachings.

<p>King’s observations show strikingly both the continuous solubility of
the soil, and the differences between the solutions derived from soils
of low and high productiveness; wholly negativing the contention of
Whitney that the solutions from different soils are of practically the
same composition.<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>
King also calls attention to the fact, shown in other experiments made
in the extraction of soils without intermediate dryings, that the
amounts extracted were very much less in subsequent than in the first
extraction; doubtless because the evaporation from the soil particles
had carried a large proportion of soluble matters to the surface,
whence it was readily abstracted by the first touch of the solvent
water. At each drying not only are the soluble matters again drawn
to the surface, but heating a soil even to 100° renders additional
amounts of soil ingredients soluble both in water and in acids. It can
scarcely be doubted that the intense heating which desert soils undergo
during the warm season is similarly effective; and thus the great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span>
productiveness of these soils under irrigation, and the marvelously
rapid development of the native vegetation when rains moisten the
parched soil, is in part at least accounted for by this immediate
availability of a large supply of plant-food.</p>

<p><i>Composition of Janesville loam.</i>—In connection with the above
data given by King, it is interesting to note the composition of the
soil in the above table yielding the highest proportions of soluble
matter, when analyzed according to the method practiced by the writer
(<a href="#Page_343">see chap. 19, p. 343</a>). This analysis was made under the
supervision of Professor Jaffa in the laboratory of the California Experiment
Station by Assistant Charles A. Triebel.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">It will be noted that in accordance with
the interpretation of analyses of soils as given in the next chapter,
this is a high-class soil in every respect, except that its content
of phosphoric acid is only just above the lower limit of sufficiency.
But as is also shown below, in presence of a large supply of lime even
lower percentages of phosphoric acid are adequate for long-continued
production (see chap. 19, pp. <a href="#Page_354">354</a>,
<a href="#Page_365">365</a>) by rendering the substance more
freely available; and that this is true in this case is shown by the
result of King’s leachings, in which this soil yields a maximum of 419
parts per million as against 80 and 64 parts in the poor soils, which
at the same time yield only one fourth as much of lime. Unfortunately
we have no full analyses of these other soils for comparison; although
they have served as a basis of comparison for years in the Washington
Bureau of Soils.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span>
<i>Solubility of Soil Phosphates in Water.</i>—The solubility of
the phosphate contents of soils has been elaborately investigated by
Th. Schloesing fils.<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>
He found in the case of a number of soils investigated by him that
the amount of phosphoric acid P₂O₅ in the soil-solution ranged from
less than one millionth (or one milligram per liter of water) in a
poor soil, to over three milligrams in a rich one. He also found that
for one and the same soil the amount so found was constant, if about
a week’s time were allowed for saturation. He calculates that while
in general the amount of phosphoric acid capable of being supplied
to the crop during a growing season of twenty-eight to thirty weeks
would suffice for but few crops, the supply so afforded is in no
case a negligible quantity, frequently amounting to more than half
of the crop-requirements. Experiments with various crops prove that
these dilute solutions are utilized by all of them, sometimes to the
extent of completely consuming the content of the solution. The much
smaller content of phosphoric acid in drain waters is accounted for
by the lack of time for full saturation during the time that the
flow lasts. Whitney, (Bureau of Soils, Bulletin 22) has extracted
the soil-solution by means of the centrifuge from several soils; the
contents of phosphoric acid thus found are in general of the same order
as those shown in the preceding table by King, but much in excess of
Schloesing’s figures; notwithstanding the fact that Whitney’s soils had
been in contact with water for only twenty-four hours. The cause of
this wide discrepancy is not clear.</p>

<p><i>Practical Conclusions from Water Extraction.</i>—As regards the
practically useful conclusions to be drawn from the extraction of soils
with pure water, the data given above, and especially the results
obtained by King, seem to prove that there is a more or less definite
correlation between the immediate productiveness of soils and the
amount and kinds of ingredients dissolved; especially in the case of
phosphoric acid, the adequacy of the supply of which for immediate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span>
production is assumed to be thus demonstrable by many French chemists.
Moreover, a number of King’s results, tabulated in curves, exhibit
a remarkable general parallelism of the curves showing totals of
plant-food extracted by water, and actual crop production. This is the
more remarkable since it is known to be, not pure water, but such as is
more or less impregnated with carbonic acid at least, that is actually
active in soil-solution and plant-nutrition. The farther development of
this method may, it would seem, lead to definite conclusions at least
in respect to the immediate productive capacity of cultivated, and
perhaps also of virgin soils. But it is not likely to give any definite
clew as to the <i>durability</i> of such lands.</p>

<h4>ASCERTAINMENT OF THE IMMEDIATE<br> PLANT-FOOD REQUIREMENTS OF CULTIVATED<br>
SOILS BY PHYSIOLOGICAL TESTS.<br> PHYSIOLOGICAL SOIL-ANALYSIS.</h4>

<p>As has already been stated, the quantitative analysis of cultivated
soils by means of strong acids affords a presumptive insight into their
immediate productiveness, and the kind of fertilizer needed to improve
it, only in case of the extreme deficiency of one or several of the
chiefly important plant-foods. The limits of deficiency of these in
virgin soils have been discussed above; but since in cultivated soils
amounts of soluble plant-food so small as to be beyond the limits
of ordinary analytical determinations, when distributed through an
acre-foot of soil may, when rightly applied, nevertheless produce very
decided effects, the indications thus obtainable are not absolute. Thus
a dressing of 150 lbs. of Chile saltpeter, containing only about 24
lbs. of nitrogen, is capable of causing the production of a full crop
of wheat where otherwise, even under favorable physical conditions,
only a fraction of a crop would have been harvested; <i>provided</i>,
that all the other requisite ingredients were present to a sufficient
extent and in available form. Yet the amount of nitrogen thus added
would amount, in one acre-foot of soil to only .0008%, say eight
ten-thousandths of one percent; which, with the amounts of substance
usually employed in soil analysis, would be an unweighable quantity,
and might easily be overlooked.</p>

<p>Since the amounts of potash and phosphoric acid actually taken out of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span>
the soil by one crop are in general of the same order of magnitude as
the above, what is taken out by one or two crops will usually fall
within the limits of analytical errors, especially of those incurred
in sampling the soil. Yet that the changes caused by a number of
successive crops can be proved, even by the ordinary methods, has been
abundantly verified. For it seems that the losses of soil ingredients
in cultivated lands exceed considerably those calculated from the
actual drain represented by the crops.</p>

<p><i>Plot Tests.</i>—There is, however, an obvious and apparently simple
method by which every farmer might make his own fertilizer tests, on
a small and inexpensive scale, the results of which may afterwards be
put in effect on his entire land. It is to apply in proper proportions
on plots (of say from one twentieth to one fortieth of an acre), the
several plant-food ingredients usually supplied in fertilizers, singly
as well as conjointly with each other, leaving check unfertilized plots
around as well as among them. By comparison with these, the cultural
results should at once determine which of the fertilizers can most
advantageously be applied to the land. Such tests when carried out with
all the proper precautions are often very decisive and practically
successful. But they so frequently suffer from seasonal influences
(such as scanty or excessive rainfall, cold or heat, etc.), inequality
of soil conditions, failure to apply the fertilizers at the right time,
or in the right way, the depredations of insects and birds, and other
causes, that it generally takes several seasons’ trial to obtain any
definite results. On level lands of uniform nature and depth, they are
most likely to be successful; while on undulating or hill lands it is
not only very difficult to secure uniformity of soil and subsoil on
areas of sufficient size, but also to prevent the washing of fertilized
soil, or fertilizer in solution, from one plot to the other by the
influence of heavy rains or irrigation; thus wholly vitiating the
experiments. In very many cases, especially in the arid region, the
results of such trials have been practically <i>nil</i>, for the reason
that physical defects of the soil, and not lack of plant-food, were the
cause of unsatisfactory production.

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</span>
A full examination of physical conditions, as outlined in previous
chapters, should <i>in all cases precede</i> the application of
fertilizers; such examination will at the same time serve to determine
the greater or less uniformity of soil-conditions, which is of first
importance to the cogency of fertilizer tests. As a matter of fact, few
farmers possess the necessary qualifications to carry out such tests
successfully, since their execution requires a certain familiarity
not only with the principles and methods of experimentation, but also
the faculty and practice of close and reasoning observation; which,
unfortunately, is not as yet a part of instruction in our schools.
The experience so often had in co-operative work between experiment
stations and farmers is cogent on this point.</p>

<p>Those desiring to do such work, however, can make use of something like
the plan given above; it being understood that in the case of clay
soils, the unplanted paths left between the plots should be at least
two feet in width; in the case of sandy soils the distance should be
not less than three feet, and more if the plots are located on a slope.
The crop from each plot should if possible be weighed as a whole; but
if the plot be large and the crop measurably uniform, an aliquot part,
such as one fourth, may be weighed instead. In regular experimentation
the crops are weighed both in the green (freshly cut) condition, and
after drying. Since the dry matter is the real basis of value in the
case of most field crops, its weight is the most important; as the
water-content of green crops may vary considerably. But in the case
of vegetables as well as fruit crops, not only must the weight of the
fresh crop be determined, but it should be sorted into the “marketable”
and “unmarketable” sizes and qualities. Failure to do this may vitiate
the entire experiment for practical purposes.</p>

<p><i>Pot Culture Tests.</i>—The uncertainty attending plot culture
tests on account of the difficulty of controlling seasonal and other
external conditions, has resulted in the extended adoption of indoor
culture tests, usually conducted in zinc or “galvanized” cylinders
of a size sufficient to contain from twelve to twenty or more
pounds of soil. These are kept in a green-house whose temperature
and moisture-condition can be regulated at will, and where the
soil-moisture is wholly under control. For investigations of the
effects of various kinds of plant-food upon vegetable development, this
method has served most satisfactorily and effectually, and striking
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</span>
photographs of results thus obtained are seen on all hands: for which
reason, to save space, they have not been introduced into this volume.
It seems at first sight that the same method should serve admirably to
determine the manure-requirements of soils under controlled conditions.</p>

<p>It must, however, be remembered that the field conditions as regards
subsoil, evaporation, ascent of moisture from below, penetration and
spread of roots, etc., in other words, all the physical conditions
so vitally concerned in crop production, except the temperature and
moisture-condition of the soil, are wholly left out of consideration in
this method. Hence the application of the results so obtained to actual
field conditions can only be made with great caution, and are often
widely discrepant with actual experience.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">The method has of late been carried to an
extreme by the U. S. Bureau of Soils in the proposition to supplant
the large soil-pots heretofore used by small paraffined wire-cloth
baskets, 3 × 3 inches in size, in which the soil to be tested is sown
with seeds which are allowed to develop only for three to five weeks;
it being claimed that the development occurring during that time is
quite sufficient to indicate what will be the ultimate outcome in
crop production. But practical experience has long ago demonstrated
that these early stages of growth cannot be relied upon to show the
crop results to be expected. Yet if this minute scale of pot-culture
should, on further test, prove to give truthful forecasts even in a
mere majority of cases, the facility with which it may be carried
out will entitle it to favorable consideration. A great deal more proof
is needed on this point than the confident claims of the Bureau indicate.</p>

<h4>CHEMICAL TESTS OF IMMEDIATE PRODUCTIVENESS.</h4>

<p><i>Testing chemical soil-character by crop analysis.</i>—Another
method for the determination of immediate soil requirements has
been elaborated by E. Godlewski.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>
The principle upon which this method rests is that plants growing in a
soil deficient in available plant-food of any one kind will in their
ash show a corresponding deficiency, or at least a minimum proportion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</span>
of the same; and that in many cases, the nature of the deficiency
manifests itself in the form or development of the plant, so clearly as
to render chemical analysis unnecessary (<a href="#Page_422">see below, chapter 22</a>).</p>

<p>To a certain extent the latter idea has been and is constantly being
utilized in practice. It is essentially involved in the habit of
judging of land by its natural vegetation; and by agricultural chemists
and intelligent farmers, when they check excessive growth of stems and
leaf (indicating excess of nitrogen) by the use of lime or phosphates;
or prescribe the use of nitrogenous manures when a superabundance of
small, unmarketable fruit is produced. From the coincidence of such
indications with the results of the analyses of soils and ashes,
very definite and permanently valuable indications as to the proper
fertilization and other treatment of the land may be deduced.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">Godlewski insists strongly, and with a good
deal of plausibility, upon the importance of making such trials in
the open field and not merely in pots. While this is true, it is also
true that such field experiments suffer from the same liability to
imperfection as the “plot fertilizer-test” plan just described; viz.,
that the season may exert a much more powerful influence than the
fertilization, and the tests may lead to wholly erroneous conclusions
unless the experiments are continued for a number of years, and under
skilled supervision. But when once the normal ratio between the ash
ingredients for a particular soil and climatic region have been
ascertained, the data will be of lasting benefit to agriculture there,
and perhaps, other things being equal, to the world at large.</p>

<p>H. Vanderyst has discussed the entire subject of physiological soil
analysis elaborately in the Revue Génerale Agronomique of Louvain,
1902-3 (Exp’t St. Record, April 1904, Vol. 8, page 757) and shows in
detail the conditions under which it may be successful. Among these he
reckons as full a knowledge of the chemical characteristics of a soil
as can be obtained by chemical analysis.</p>

<p><i>Chemical Tests of Immediately Available Plant-food.</i>—It is
scarcely doubtful that plants differ considerably in the energy of
their action upon the “reserve” soil ingredients; hence no one solvent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</span>
used by the analyst could represent correctly the action of plant-roots
in general upon the soil, even if we could give that action the same
time (a growing season) and opportunity afforded them in nature by
the root-surface. We are forced to proceed empirically; and among the
numerous solvents suggested for the purpose of soil extraction, that of
Dyer, already mentioned, viz., a one per cent solution of citric acid,
making allowance for such neutralization as may occur in the soil, has
seemed to the writer to give results most largely in agreement with
cultural experience. Walter Maxwell has recommended aspartic acid in
lieu of citric, as approaching nearer to practical results, at least
with sugar-cane.</p>

<p>According to the investigations of Dyer, on Rothamstead soils of
known productiveness or manurial condition, it appears that when the
citric-acid extraction yields as much as .005% of potash and .010% of
phosphoric acid, the supply is adequate for normal crop production,
so that the use of the above substances as fertilizers would be, if
not ineffective, at least not a profitable investment. These figures
refer to the ordinary field crops of England and to soils originally
fertile and well supplied with lime. It can readily be foreseen that
under other climatic and soil conditions, different figures may have to
be established. So far as the writer’s experience goes, however, the
above figures are very nearly valid for the arid climates as well; only
the figures obtained for arid soils are usually far in excess of the
above minimum postulates. Figures for lime and nitrogen are given in
chapters 8 and 19. But the results obtained with the highly ferruginous
soils of Hawaii show that under such conditions, figures far exceeding
the minimum ones established by Dyer nevertheless coexist with need of
phosphate fertilization.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle">THE ANALYSIS OF VIRGIN SOILS BY<br>
EXTRACTION WITH STRONG ACIDS.</span></h3>
</div>

<p>As stated already, the analysis of soils by extraction with
strong acids is intended to enlighten us, not in regard to their
<i>immediate</i> productiveness (the “Düngerzustand” of German
agricultural chemists), but as to their <i>permanent value or
productive capacity</i>. As has been seen in the preceding chapter,
the efforts to unite investigators upon a generally applicable and
acceptable method for the testing of immediate productiveness have not
been very successful, and the number of methods employed in different
countries and by different chemists within the same country are widely
at variance, with no immediate prospect of agreement. Moreover, in
most cases the effort is to combine both problems—<i>temporary</i>
and <i>permanent</i> productive capacity—in <i>one</i> method or
operation; which still farther confuses the issue.</p>

<p>Convinced that the only way to unification lies in the direction of
falling back upon a method that is based upon a natural limitation
about which there can be no difference of opinion, the writer has,
in following the lead of Owen and Robert Peter, endeavored to settle
definitely <i>the natural limit of the action of a suitable acid
upon soils, and the time and strength of acid producing the maximum
effect</i>.</p>

<p><i>Loughridge’s Investigation.</i>—Systematic work on these points
was undertaken, at his suggestion, by Dr. R. H. Loughridge in 1871 and
1872. The results of this work were published in the succeeding year
in the Amer. Journal of Science, and in the proceedings of the A. A.
A. S. for 1873. They seem to be of sufficient general interest to be
reproduced here.</p>

<p>The soil selected for this purpose was a very generalized one,
representing large areas in the states of Kentucky, Tennessee,
Mississippi and Louisiana, bordering on the east the immediate valley of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</span>
the Mississippi river, and known locally as the “Table lands;” a noted
cotton-producing upland region. The brown or yellow, moderately clayey
loam is of great uniformity throughout its region of occurrence, and is
evidently derived from such widely-spread sources that it represents
no special rock or complex of rocks. Its natural growth is a mixture
of oaks and hickories, strong and well-developed trees, such as any
land-seeker would at once approve for settlement. Its cotton product
when fresh was a 400-pound bale of cotton lint per acre. It may
therefore well be considered a typical generalized soil of the humid
upland of the Mississippi valley. Its physical analysis is given in
chapter 6, it being <a href="#Page_98">No. 219 of the table on p. 98</a>.</p>

<p><i>Strength of Acid used.</i>—Three different strengths of acid were
simultaneously employed, viz., chlorhydric of 1.10, 1.115 and 1.160
density. With these the soil was digested at steam heat in porcelain
beakers covered with watch glasses for five days each, then evaporated
and analyzed as usual. The results were as follows:</p>

<p>It will be noted that the strongest acid produced the smallest amount
of decomposition of the soil silicates, <i>e. g.</i> the silica
soluble in carbonate of soda solution being 3% less than in the
case of the acid of medium strength; a result possibly due to some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</span>
difficultly-soluble compound formed on the surface of the soil grains.
The weakest acid had a stronger solvent power; but the maximum effect
was produced by the acid of 1.115 density. This being also the most
readily obtainable, by simple steam distillation of acid of any other
strength, the writer adopted it as best suited to the purposes of soil
analysis.</p>

<p>To ascertain the time required for the desired action, viz., the
solution of the plant-food ingredients to the extent likely to be of
any avail to growing plants, digestions of the same soil were made in
the same manner for periods of 1, 3, 4, 5 and 10 days, with the acid of
1.115 density. The results were as follows:</p>

<p>While these results pointed clearly to the five-day period as being
sufficiently effective so far as the plant-food ingredients are
concerned, it was not easy to understand why a ten-day digestion should
be less incisive than a five-day one. Instead of repeating the ten-day
experiment, it was thought preferable to re-treat the residue from the
five-day digestion for five days more. The result was that only more
silica and alumina went into solution—in other words, additional clay
was alone being decomposed. This being of no interest in the matter of
plant nutrition, the five-day period was definitely adopted by the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</span>
writer for his work; and it, together with the acid of 1.115 density,
is the basis of all the results given in this volume, except where
otherwise stated. There appeared to him to be no good reason for the
acceptance of the arbitrary method of soil-extraction suggested by
Kedzie and since adopted by the Association of Official Agricultural
Chemists; the more as to do so would throw out of comparison all the
previous work done by Owen, Peter, and himself and his pupils, which
had already been definitely correlated with the natural conditions and
with cultural experience.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p><i>Virgin Soils with High Plant-food Percentages are Always
Productive.</i>—In strong contrast to the contradictory evidence
deduced from the analysis, by any method, of cultivated soils when
compared with cultural experience, it seems to be generally true that
<i>virgin soils showing high percentages of plant-food as ascertained
by extraction with strong acids</i> (such as hydrochloric, nitric,
etc.), <i>invariably prove highly productive</i>: provided only that
extreme physical characters do not interfere with normal plant growth,
as is sometimes the case with heavy clays, or very coarse sandy
lands.—<i>To this rule no exception has thus far been found.</i> The
composition of some representative soils falling within this category
is given in the annexed table, which at the same time conveys some idea
of the proportion of acid-soluble ingredients usually found in the best
class of natural soils.

<i>Discussion of Table.</i>—It will be noted in this table that while
the total of the matters soluble in acids (inclusive of silica) ranges
from a little below 50 to over 77 per cent, the total of directly
important mineral plant-food ingredients (potash, lime, magnesia and
phosphoric acid), constitute in moderately calcareous soils only from
about 2.5 to somewhat over four per cent of the whole. Yet if all
these were in available form, the supply would be abundant for many
hundreds and even thousands of crop years. For, one-tenth of one per
cent in the case of the clayey soils of the preceding table would
amount to about 3500 pounds per acre-foot, and to 4000 in the case of
the sandy ones. Hence the amount of phosphoric acid in <i>e. g.</i>,
the Mississippi delta soil from Houma would suffice for the production
of about 440 crops of wheat grain (at 20 bushels per acre) if only one
foot depth were drawn upon; but as the roots of grain easily penetrate
to twice and half and three times that depth even in the humid region,
the number might be tripled. As a matter of fact, however, that soil
has produced full crops for from forty to fifty years only; yet this
is considered an exceptionally long duration of profitable production
without fertilization.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">The first and last soils in the above list
represent probably the highest types of productiveness known. The
Yazoo bottom soil has produced up to one thousand pounds of cotton
lint per acre when fresh, and is still producing from four to five
hundred pounds after thirty years’ culture. The Arroyo Grande soil
of California with its extraordinary percentages of phosphoric acid
and nitrogen, as well as exceptionally high proportion of available
phosphoric acid and potash, has made such a record of productiveness,
and high quality of the seeds produced, that it has for a number
of years been excluded from competition for prizes offered by
seed-producers elsewhere, in order to give other sections a chance.
Both these soils are rather heavy clays, but readily tillable in
consequence of their abundant lime-content. The remarkably high
content of acid-soluble silica, indicating the presence of much easily
available zeolitic matter, is doubtless connected with the exceptional
productiveness.</p>

<p>Experience, then, proves that lands showing such high plant-food
percentages will yield profitable harvests for a long time without
fertilization, or with only such partial returns as are afforded by
the offal of crops. Also that when fertilization comes to be required,
instead of supplying <i>all</i> the ingredients usually constituting
fertilizers, only one or two of these will as a rule be actually
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</span>
needed, and even these in smaller amounts than in “poor” lands; thus
materially reducing the expense of fertilization. The high production
and durability of such lands therefore amply justify their higher
pecuniary valuation; for which there would be no rational permanent
ground if they required fertilization to the same extent as poor lands.
In other words, if the entire amount of soil-ingredients removed by
crops had had to be currently replaced equally in <i>all</i> cases
(as is implied in the hypothesis, advanced by some, that the chemical
composition of soils is of no practical consequence), the high prices
which from time immemorial have been paid for black prairie and rich
alluvial lands as against meagre uplands and barrens, would have been
so much money wasted.</p>

<p>The explanation of these advantages evidently lies largely in the
larger amounts of soil ingredients annually rendered available in rich
soils by the fallowing effect of the atmospheric agencies, because
of the generous totals present. The actual <i>amounts</i> of soil
ingredients thus rendered accessible to plants, other things being
equal, are evidently more or less directly <i>proportional to the
totals of acid-soluble plant-food ingredients present</i>. And if this
is true in cultivated lands, the inevitable conclusion is that the
same must be true of virgin lands; <i>whose productive capacity and
duration can therefore be forecast by such analyses</i>. It will be
observed that the above data, which could be indefinitely increased
by corroborative analyses, seem to establish the fact that about one
per cent of acid-soluble potash, one of lime, the same, or less, of
magnesia, and .15% of phosphoric acid, are thus shown to be “high”
percentages of these ingredients in virgin soils.</p>

<p>It is not easy to see how the above conclusions can be successfully
controverted; they are, moreover, thoroughly in accordance with
cultural experience. Difficulties of interpretation arise mainly in
the case of medium soils, which show neither very high nor very low
percentages of plant-food; and which raise the question of what amount
or percentage constitutes “adequacy” of each of the several substances.</p>

<p><i>Low Percentages.</i>—On the other hand, whenever in virgin soils
acid-analysis shows the presence of but a <i>very</i> small proportion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</span>
of one or several of the essential ingredients, we have a valuable
indication as to the one of these that will first be required to be
added when production slackens.</p>

<p><i>What are “Adequate” Percentages of Potash, Lime, Phosphoric Acid
and Nitrogen?</i>—It is evident that a very critical discussion of
cultural experience can alone answer this question; and at first sight
such experience often appears very contradictory when compared with the
results of analysis.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">One of the chief causes of such apparent
discrepancies is readily intelligible when we consider the differences
in root-development of the same plant in different soils. In “light” or
sandy lands the roots may penetrate to several times the depth attained
by them in heavy clay soils. Having thus within their reach a soil-mass
several times larger, and aerated to a much greater depth, it is but
reasonable to expect that in deep, sandy lands plants would do equally
well with correspondingly smaller percentages of plant-food than would
suffice in clay soils, in which the root-range is very much more
restricted. The well-known fact that the production of heavy clay lands
may be increased by their intermixture with mere sand, adding nothing
to their store of plant-food, emphasizes this expectation and elevates
it into a maxim. On this ground alone, therefore, it is evident that
the mere consideration of plant-food <i>percentages</i> found, can be
a true measure of productiveness only in the case of virgin soils with
<i>high</i> percentages.</p>

<p><i>Soil Dilution Experiments.</i>—The extent to which dilution
with mere “lightening” materials can be carried without impairing
production, can of course be determined for concrete cases only; but
the following experiment made at the California Station is a case in
point:</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">One kilogram of the heavy but highly
productive black clay soil of the experimental grounds of the
University of California was used in each of five experimental
cultures, each made in duplicate, in cylindrical vessels of
zinc-covered (“galvanized”) sheet iron, all proportioned alike in
height and diameter, but containing respectively one, two, four, five
and six volumes of total soil. In the smallest was placed one kilogram
of the undiluted, original soil, in the others successively the same
amount of the soil thoroughly mixed with one, three, four, and five
volumes of a dune sand fully extracted with chlorhydric acid, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</span>
washed with distilled water. The water capacity of each of the
mixtures was determined and the earth in the pots kept at the point of
half-saturation generally admitted to be the optimum (best condition)
for plant growth. Each pot was sown with ten seeds of white mustard,
subsequently reduced to five plants selected for their vigor.</p>

<p>The (“galvanized”) vegetation pots were made as nearly as possible of
similar proportions in depth and width for each dilution, so as to give
opportunity for the proportional development of the root systems. The
photographs show the latter as nearly as practicable in their natural

extremely difficult to preserve intact the extreme circumferential

<p class="blockquot fs_90">The restricted volume of soil occupied by
the roots in the undiluted adobe soil, together with the very abundant
development of root-hairs, is very striking. A marked change in these
respects is manifest in the first dilution, and increasingly so as
dilution increases; the paucity of root-hairs is very marked in the
last (greatest) dilution, in which, as the photograph of the plants
shows, the development was decidedly behind that in the pot containing
dilution 1:4. The latter in fact showed the best development not only
in this case, but in two other series of tests conducted at the same
and subsequent times; and strangely enough, also in the pulverulent,
“sandy loam” soil of the southern California substation tract. In the
latter series, which for lack of space cannot be figured here, the main
difference was that in the undiluted soil the roots filled the entire
soil mass, instead of remaining near the surface, as in the pure adobe.
It is possible that the latter was too wet when given the full half of
its water-capacity, although, as the figures show, the water was slowly
introduced from below by means of glass tubes, ending within a shield
to prevent puddling.</p>

<p><i>Limitation of Root Action.</i>—These results, representing five
soils of different percentage-composition and physical character,
but identical chemical composition and ratios between the several
ingredients, and similarly acted upon by the atmospheric agencies in
the past, illustrate strikingly the impossibility of judging correctly
of a soil’s productiveness from <i>percentages</i> of chemical
ingredients alone. It is clear that the physical characters of the land
as well as its depth, must be essentially taken into account. But there
is obviously a certain limit beyond which greater perviousness and
root-penetration cannot make up for deficiency in the absolute amounts
of plant-food within possible reach of the plant; for in the case of
excessive dilution these are rendered partially inaccessible within the
time-limits of a season’s growth.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to say that these experiments require repetition
with the aid of the experience acquired in these first trials, not
only in the laboratory but also in the field. It will be especially
interesting to compare with the results obtained in these strongly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</span>
calcareous soils, the effects of dilution in such soils as those
of Florida, mentioned below; the probability being that where lime
is naturally deficient, the effects of dilution will be much more
pronounced in diminishing production, because of the absence of
the previous favorable action of lime upon the availability of the
soil-ingredients.</p>

<p>The average of plant-food percentages in all these soils is quite
low, and at first sight there seems to be little choice between them.
Yet two of them—Nos. 68 and 88, from Mississippi—are not only quite
productive at the outset, but also fairly durable. This becomes
measurably intelligible when it is known that both are of great depth,
and so well drained that roots can descend for many feet; while the
composition of the soil-material is almost identical for three or four
feet. On the other hand, both Nos. 206 and 214 are quite shallow, being
underlaid by sand almost devoid of plant-food at about two feet. In
addition, both have extremely low percentages of phosphoric acid; while
the rest show near .10% of that ingredient, an amount which, as will be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</span>
seen hereafter, is considerably above the recognized limit of
deficiency. The two Florida soils however bear only pine; they are
underlaid by almost clean sand at two or three feet, and are therefore
quickly exhausted. It will also be noted that their lime-percentage is
only about half of that of the two first-named Mississippi soils, both
of which bear a strong growth of deciduous timber trees, grape vines,
and other vegetation indicating the presence of lime carbonate.</p>

<p>It is noteworthy, also, that the popular classification of the
two Florida soils corresponds exactly with the differences in the
percentages of plant-food; those in the “second-class” soil being
uniformly lower than those in the one designated as first-class. This
indicates, again, that <i>as between soils of similar character and
origin, the production and durability are sensibly proportional to the
plant-food percentages</i> when the latter fall below a certain limit;
a point more fully illustrated farther on.</p>

<p>In the light of the above experiment and tables, it becomes pertinent
to consider what <i>are</i> the lowest percentage limits of each of the more
important plant-food ingredients compatible with profitable production.</p>

<h4>LIMITS OF ADEQUACY OF THE SEVERAL<br> PLANT-FOODS IN VIRGIN SOILS.</h4>

<p>It is obvious that the lower limits of adequacy of the critical
plant-food ingredients are best ascertained in the case of virgin
soils containing very small amounts of some <i>one</i> ingredient,
while fairly or fully supplied with the rest. In such cases, which
are not at all infrequent, the use of the deficient ingredient as a
fertilizer should produce a very marked effect so soon as the first
flush of production (always noted in fresh soil) is over. This first
productiveness may, even in poor lands, range from one to three years,
when there is a sudden decline.</p>

<p><i>Lime a Dominant Factor.</i>—When we investigate the cases of such
lands, it soon becomes apparent that besides the low percentage of
any one ingredient, the <i>proportions</i> of others present require
consideration. Among these, <i>lime</i> in the form of carbonate stands
foremost. Its presence exerts a dominant and beneficial influence in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</span>
many respects, as is readily apparent from the prompt change in
vegetation whenever it is introduced into soils deficient in it. In
discussing the results of soil analysis, its consideration is of first
importance in forecasting correctly the adequacy or inadequacy of
other soil ingredients (<a href="#Page_379">see chapter 20, page 379</a>). For
in general, we find that <i>lower percentages of potash, phosphoric acid and
nitrogen are adequate, when a large proportion of lime carbonate is
present</i>.—This has already been referred to in connection with the
table of soils of low percentages, given above. In the interpretation
of results obtained by analysis this point must always be kept in view;
and in the numerical statements made below, it must be understood that
they refer to virgin soils sufficiently supplied with lime to assure
a constant excess of lime carbonate, maintaining the conditions of
nitrification and insuring the absence of acidity. (<a href="#Page_146">See
chapter 9, page 146</a>).</p>

<p><i>Potash.</i>—In respect to potash, the writer was led by his early
investigations in the State of Mississippi to conclude that less than
one-fourth of one per cent (.25) of potash constituted a deficiency
likely to call for early fertilization with potash salts; while as much
as .45% of the same seemed to cause the land to respond but feebly to
such fertilization. He has not found it necessary to revise materially
that early conclusion, whether from his own work or from that of
others. Within the last decade, Prof. Liebscher of Göttingen<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>
has arrived at this identical figure from analyses made of soils upon which
he had conducted a seven-year series of fertilizer tests; he having
found that potash fertilization produced no sensible, or at least no
paying results on land giving that figure, and otherwise well provided
with plant-food. The different (lower) figures given by Schloesing,
Risler and other French chemists in discussing the soils of France are
doubtless due to the weak acid and short period of digestion employed
in the analysis; an unfortunate discrepancy of methods which precludes
any direct comparison of results.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</span></p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">These figures apply both to the arid and
the humid regions in the temperate zones. In the tropics we find very
much lower percentages quoted as adequate; thus in the laterite soils
of India and Samoa, according to Wohltmann, in the soils of Jamaica
according to Fawcett, and in those of Madagascar according to Müntz and
Rousseaux.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>
There, potash-percentages over .10% seem to be high, and in
Madagascar some lands in fair production range as low as .01%. The
soil-extractions have however in these cases been made with a weaker
acid than above specified, so that some increase of the figures
(perhaps 33 to 50%) have to be allowed for. But even then there
can be no question that a far less amount of potash, as determined
by acid-extraction, is found sufficient for crop production in
the tropics; doubtless because of the very intense decomposing
(“fallowing”) effect of the continuous heat and moisture, tending
also to a rapid decomposition of organic matter and a proportionally
rapid formation of carbonic and nitric acids. Such soils are of course
constantly kept in a leached condition, as a result of the heavy and
continuous rainfall.</p>

<p><i>Phosphoric Acid.</i>—As regards the lower limit of adequacy of
phosphoric acid, there is a remarkable agreement in the investigations
made everywhere. It was placed at .05% by the writer as long ago as
1860, as the result of investigations made in the State of Mississippi;
and the same figure has since been arrived at independently by
agricultural chemists in France, Russia, Germany and England. The cause
of this remarkable agreement is undoubtedly the readiness with which
the phosphates that come under consideration at all for the nutrition
of plants, are dissolved by almost any acid treatment likely to be
used in soil analysis. Almost the same agreement exists in regard to
the “adequacy” of .1% of P₂O₅; while all soils showing percentages
between .1 and .05% are considered weak on this side, and liable to
need phosphate fertilization soon. One-fourth of one per cent is
an unusually high percentage in most countries; .30% and over is
exceptional in non-ferruginous soils. But as stated on a previous page,
a high percentage of lime carbonate may offset a smaller percentage of
phosphoric acid, apparently by bringing about greater availability; and a
similar effect seems to result from the presence of a large supply of humus.</p>

<p>On the other hand, very large percentages of finely divided ferric
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</span>
hydrate may, especially in the absence of lime carbonate, render even
large supplies of phosphoric acid inert and useless, by the formation
of the totally insoluble ferric phosphate. Aluminic hydrate probably
acts in a similar manner. The following table gives examples in point,
as regards ferric hydrate.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90"><i>Unavailability of Ferric
Phosphate.</i>—It will be noted that in the soils from Oahu with an
overwhelming amount of ferric oxid (mostly in the form of hydrate
or rust) the citric acid has taken up only an insignificant amount
of phosphoric acid; nitric acid took up 40 to 50 times as much, and
chlorhydric doubled even this. In the much less ferruginous Hawaiian
soils, though containing more alumina, the citric acid extracted nearly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</span>
ten times as much; proving that it is chiefly ferric oxid, and not
the alumina as has been supposed, that causes the insolubility of
phosphoric acid in soils and doubtless also in fertilizers. The very
unusually high content of phosphoric acid in the Hawaiian soils,
exceeding all others on record, so far as known to the writer,
emphasize the effects of ferric hydrate upon soluble phosphates;
while the fact that these very soils are greatly benefited by the use
of phosphate fertilizers, proves that the Dyer (citric acid) method
for the determination of available phosphoric acid which in soils
Nos. 21 to 26 yielded results largely in excess of the established
limit in European soils, cannot be successfully applied to these
highly ferruginous soils. It should also be noted that the amounts of
phosphoric acid found in the humus extracted by the Grandeau method is
in the first two Hawaiian soils over ten times the amount extracted by
citric acid, but that while they rise and fall together, no definite
quantitative ratio exists between the two.</p>

<p>It is obvious that in such soils, fertilization with water-soluble
phosphates would be likely to result in the quick partial withdrawal of
the same from useful action, and that any excess not promptly taken up
by the crop, is likely to become inert and useless. It will evidently
be desirable to use the phosphates in the form of bone meal or basic
slag (Thomas Phosphate), which because of their difficult solubility
will be acted upon but very slowly, if at all, by the ferric and

<p><i>Nitrogen.</i>—In determining the nitrogen-content of the soil, a
great variety of methods has been followed. Some include all that can
be obtained by the combustion of the organic matters of soil and from
the nitrates present in the same; while others, the writer among the
number, believe that the mainly important source of nitrogen to the
plant being the nitrification of the humus-nitrogen, the determination
of the humus by the method of Grandeau, and of the nitrogen contained
in it, should be the standard; the unhumified vegetable matter being of
no definitely ascertainable value, and the nitrates varying from day
to day and being liable to be lost by leaching at any time; therefore
forming no permanent feature of the soil. Considering the variety of
methods, the unanimity with which about one-tenth of one per cent (.10)
has been assumed as the ordinarily adequate percentage is remarkable.
In view of the extremely variable amount of nitrogen in the humus
(ranging from 1.7 to nearly 22%), the amount of the latter cannot, of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</span>
course, afford even an approximation to the nitrogen-content;
except that as in the humid region, the nitrogen-percentage is not
known to exceed about 5 or 5.5%, an approximate estimate can be
made on that basis. In the arid region, according to location, the
nitrogen-percentage may be from three to six times greater for a
similar amount of humus. (<a href="#Page_135">See chap. 8. p. 135</a>). In the
writer’s experience, a nitrogen-percentage of .1% in the arid region is a very
satisfactory figure, indicating that the need of nitrogen-fertilization
is not likely to arise for a number of years.</p>

<p><i>Nitrification of the Organic Matter of the Soil.</i>—In order to
test the question whether or not the nitrogen of the unhumified debris
existing in surface soils is directly nitrifiable, the writer selected
a soil which in its natural condition sustains intense nitrification,
so that at some points it contains as much as 1200 pounds of sodic
nitrate per acre. The composition of this soil, representing the land
of the “ten-acre tract” of the southern California substation, is as
follows:</p>

It will be noticed that this is a rather strongly calcareous soil,
(nearly 9% of calcic carbonate), slightly impregnated with alkali,
of which about one-ninth is saltpeter. One portion of this soil was
thoroughly leached with distilled water until not a trace of nitrates
could be detected in the leachings. Another portion was treated for the
removal of humus according to the Grandeau method (<a href="#Page_132">see
chapter 8, page 132</a>); the extracted soil showed under the microscope an abundance
of vegetable debris, some slightly browned as from incipient humification.</p>

<p>The calcic and magnesic carbonates withdrawn in the humus-extraction
were then restored to the soil in the form of finely divided
precipitates and thoroughly mixed in, first in the dry and then in the
wet condition; the extracted soil being repeatedly wetted with turbid
water from the leached soil, in order to replace and reinfect it with
the nitrifying bacteria. Both soils were then spread out in flat glass
dishes and placed in a wooden box containing also a similar flat dish
with distilled water, upon which played the draught from the inlet
pipe opening into the outer air, with outlet-holes in the cover at the
opposite end; thus keeping the air within fairly moist. In addition,
the soils themselves were moistened with distilled water every three
days and restored to a loose condition by stirring. The whole was
placed so as to maintain, during the greater part of the 24 hours, a
temperature of from 30 to 35 degrees C. At intervals the samples of
both soils were leached and color-titrated for their nitrate content by
the picric-acid test. The results, calculated as sodic nitrate, during
two years were as follows:</p>

<p>It will be noted that in the course of four months, nitrification
had not sensibly set in the extracted soil; while in the leached
natural soil the nitrate-content had reached to three-fifths the amount
originally present, and in the course of a year the nitrate-content
of the latter was more than double that of the original (unleached)
soil; while that in the extracted soil had only reached one-seventh
of the same. At the end of two years we find a still farther increase
of nitric nitrogen in both, the ratio between the two remaining about
the same (1:14). At the same time the ratio of increase attained at
first had materially diminished in the water-leached soil, probably on
account of the accumulation of the niter itself.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</span></p>

<p>It thus appears that although the nitrogen of the unhumified organic
matter constituted about 40% of the total in the original soil, it
would during the entire year have contributed only to an insignificant
extent to the available nitrate-supply; while the fully humified
“matière noire” contributed fourteen times as much. During the ordinary
growing-season of four or five months the unhumified organic matter
would have yielded practically nothing to the crop.</p>

<p><i>Functions of the unhumified Vegetable Matter.</i>—The chief
utility of the unhumified matter in the soil consists of course in
its gradual conversion into true humus, in the course of which it
evolves carbonic gas to act on the soil minerals; while at the same
time it helps to render the soil more porous and thus facilitates the
action of the aerobic bacteria, for which it serves as food. Hence
the addition of vegetable matter to soils not already too “light”
is always advantageous, so long as it does not introduce injurious,
non-humifiable ingredients, like turpentine in the sawdust of resinous
pines. But it is always advisable to first use such matter as litter
for stock, in order to better prepare it for the processes of
humification, under the influence of ammoniacal fermentation, such as
occurs in the decay of green plants or animal matter. A portion of the
ash ingredients also is quickly utilized by solution in the soil-water.</p>

<p><i>Matière Noire the Only Guide.</i>—According to these results it is
clear that in order to gain any tangible indications with respect to
crop-bearing, it is the nitrogen in the humus proper, the <i>matière
noire</i> only, that should serve as the basis; and that as a current
source of nitrogen to the plant, the unhumified matter is hardly
entitled to more consideration than the “insoluble silicates.” For,
the favorable conditions for nitrification under which the above
experiment was conducted, will very rarely be even approached under
field conditions.</p>

<p><i>What are the Adequate Nitrogen Percentages in the Humus</i>?—The
nitrification of the <i>matière noire</i> being, apparently, the main
source of plant-nutrition with that element under ordinary conditions,
the question naturally arises as to what may be considered an adequate
nitrogen-content of that substance, so as to permit a full supply of
nitrates to the crop.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</span></p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">The data extant on this subject are rather
scanty, and thus far have all been obtained at the California Experiment
Station.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>
But they seem to be very cogent in proving that the growth of crops
removed from the soil causes a rapid depletion of the nitrogen in
the humus-substance, and that <i>so soon as the nitrogen-percentage
in the same falls below a certain point, the soil becomes
“nitrogen-hungry;”</i> so that the application of nitrogenous
fertilizers is needed and is very effective. The data in the table
below, as well as the figure of a culture experiment (No. 52 below),
illustrate this point.</p>

<div class="blockquot fs_90"><p>Nos. 6 and 1679 show the usual
humus-and nitrogen-percentages in the “black adobe” or “prairie” soils
of California. Nos. 1842 and 1841 represent the same soil as 1679, upon
which, however, ramie and ray grass had respectively been growing,
without fertilization, for about ten years; showing that while the
<i>humus-content of the soil has increased, the nitrogen-content
of the humus has decreased</i> in the case of ramie by 72.78%,
in that of the grass by 76.78%; reducing the land to figures commonly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</span>
found in the humid region. In the case of the ramie, the partial return
through the leaves has resulted in a higher humus-content, together
with higher nitrogen-percentage, than in the case of the grass, which
in the several cuttings annually made, caused a greater depletion in
nitrogen and a smaller accession of humus. The grass was very weak in
its growth and partially dying out.</p>

<p>No. 29, the sugar-cane land from Maui, was still in fair production,
but beginning to weaken as against its first production. No. 27,
the guava land from Hawaii, originally bore a luxuriant cover of
wild guava, but after bearing one fair crop of seed-cane and one of
ratoons, the cane planted on it “spindled up” and died so soon as the
seed-cane planted was exhausted. Both the island soils, originally
derived from the weathering of the black basaltic lavas of the region,
were well supplied with mineral plant-food (see above, page 356), and
the humus-content in both was exceptionally high; and neither was in
an acid condition. The difference in their nitrogen-content, both in
the totals and in the humus itself, suggested that notwithstanding
the relatively high total of nitrogen in No. 27, it might be nitrogen-hungry,
in view of the low percentage of the nitrogen in the humus.</p>

          Soil from Hawaii Island.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Confirmatory Experiment.</i>—A pot-culture with wheat, the results
of which are shown in the <a href="#FIG_59">figure below</a>, fully confirm this suspicion.
One kilogram of soil was used in each of two pots, one being fertilized
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</span>
with half a gram of Chile saltpeter. The experiment could not be
carried to full completion on account of the overwhelming invasion
of mildew; but the figures speak for themselves. Moreover, a field
trial made on the island with saltpeter, in pursuance of the writer’s
recommendation, resulted in a luxuriant growth of the cane.</p>

<p><i>Data for Nitrogen-adequacy.</i>—It appears from the facts shown
above, that for the growth of grasses a nitrogen-percentage in the
humus of 1.7 is wholly inadequate, no matter how much humus may be
present. A percentage of 3.15 in the Maui soil, No. 29, containing
nearly 11% of humus, gave only a fair crop of sugar-cane; on the
Berkeley grass plot, with 3.40% and only 1.65 of total humus, the ray
grass was barely maintaining life. The ramie, with 4.17% of nitrogen in
the soil-humus, was still doing fairly well.</p>

<p>It is doubtless impossible to give one and the same absolute figure for
nitrogen-deficiency for all plants and soils. Where the conditions of
nitrification are favorable, as in the presence of much of the earth
carbonates, a smaller percentage may suffice for the same plants that
elsewhere suffer; and it is highly probable that different minima will
be found for plants of different relationship and root-habits. But
there is every reason to believe that <i>in the nitrogen-percentage of
soil-humus, considered in connection with other chemical and physical
conditions and soil derivations</i>, we have a means of ascertaining
the needs of plants with respect to nitrogen-fertilization, if proper
study be given to the subject. Broadly speaking, it appears to be
necessary <i>to keep the nitrogen-percentage of soil-humus near 4% to
insure satisfactory production</i>.</p>

<p>It having been suggested that the frequent and disastrous crop failures
on the noted tchernozem or black-earth soils of Russia might be due in
part at least to nitrogen-depletion of the humus, the writer obtained
through the courtesy of Prof. P. Kossovitch of St. Petersburg soil
samples from the center of the Black-earth region, both cultivated and
uncultivated. These samples are in appearance exactly like some of the
dark alluvial soils of Louisiana and California, and approach them very
nearly in the essentials of composition, as will be seen from the table below:

<p>It will be seen that the Russian soil is of high fertility according
to the standards given above, and that the nitrogen-content of the
abundant humus is amply within the limits of adequacy suggested by the
experience in California and Hawaii. The humus-content of the arid
California soils is characteristically low as compared with the Russian
tchernozem as well as with the Houma backland of humid Louisiana; but
its nitrogen-content is doubtless at least three times that of the latter,
as is that of the humus of similar lands in which it has been determined.

<h4>INFLUENCE OF LIME UPON SOIL FERTILITY.</h4>

<p>Assuming as substantially correct the numerical data given above in
respect to the three leading ingredients of plant-food—phosphoric
acid, potash and nitrogen,—the dominant role of lime in soil
fertility, already mentioned, requires some farther illustration and
discussion.</p>

<p>“<i>A Lime Country is a Rich Country.</i>”—The instant change of
vegetation when we pass from a non-calcareous region to one having
calcareous soils, has already been alluded to. (<a href="#Page_354">See this chapter, p. 354)</a>.
But it is not necessary to be a botanist to see the change in the
prosperity of the farming population as one enters a lime district.
The single log-cabin with, probably, a wooden barrel terminating the
mud-plastered chimney, is replaced, first by double log-houses, then by
frame, and farther on by brick buildings, with the other unmistakable
evidences of prosperity. Thus this is seen in passing from the mountain
region of Kentucky into the “blue-grass” country, which is throughout
underlaid by calcareous formations; and thus, likewise, in crossing the
strike of the formations of Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana, or any
other region where underlying calcareous formations have contributed
to the formation of the soils, as compared with some adjacent district
where this is not the case. The calcareous loess areas bordering on the
Mississippi river and some of its chief tributaries, are conspicuous
cases in point, as are also the prairies of Illinois and Indiana.</p>

<p><i>Effects of High Lime-content in Soils.</i>—The table below
illustrates the fact that in the presence of high lime-percentages,
relatively low percentages of phosphoric acid and potash may
nevertheless prove adequate; while the same, or even higher amounts,
in the absence of satisfactory lime-percentages prove insufficient for
good production.<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>

<div class="blockquot fs_90">
<p>Nos. 139 and 171 are heavy black prairie soils of high productive
capacity, whose production had, at the time of sampling, lasted
almost undiminished for over twenty years. Nearly the same is true
of the two California soils, Nos. 499 and 1113; which, however, are
ferruginous loams of only moderate clay-content. In all, the percentage
of phosphoric acid shown by the analysis is at or below the recognized
limit of deficiency, while the lime-content of all is as high as
is required for the welfare of any soil, however constituted. The
potash-percentage also is low in all except the “red foothill soil,”
No. 1113.</p>

<p>Passing to the soils of low lime-content, we find the two
Mississippi soils, poor in both potash, lime and phosphoric acid, so
low in production as to be wholly unprofitable in cultivation without
previous fertilization; No. 559, from California, produced two fair
crops of barley and then no more. No. 207, is the soil of Eel river
bottom, California; profusely productive at first, by virtue of its
high content of both potash and phosphoric acid; but “giving out”
under a few years’ culture of clover or alfalfa (which draw heavily
upon lime), and quickly restored to productiveness under the influence
of dressings of quicklime. In this case the soil had become acid, a
condition which always militates against the success of culture plants,
and more especially against those of the leguminous relationship.</p>
</div>

<p><i>What are Adequate Lime Percentages?</i>—We have in the presence
or absence of the natural vegetation peculiar to calcareous soils
(“calciphile”) an excellent index of the presence or absence of such
amounts of lime carbonate as fulfil the conditions of its beneficial
effects. Lists of such plants for the United States are given farther
on; they agree almost throughout with such plants as are everywhere
recognized by American farmers as indicating productive soils.</p>

<p>All soils bearing such vegetation show with red litmus paper, when
wetted, a neutral reaction at first, which after the lapse of twenty or
thirty minutes turns to a blue alkaline one; such as is given under the
same conditions by the carbonates of lime and magnesia.</p>

<p>But the reverse is not necessarily true; for we occasionally find soils
containing considerable amounts of lime carbonate that yet fail to
bear lime vegetation. This is the case of extremely heavy clay soils,
as exemplified in the table below in the case of the last three soils;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</span>
while the first, No. 220, exemplifies a case where although potash is
exceptionally high, only scrubby oak growth is produced in presence
of an amount of lime that in sandy lands would show profuse lime growth.</p>

<p>All of the soils in this table are heavy clays, very difficult to till;
in all, the lime-percentage falls below .5%; and none bear any lime
vegetation, the Mississippi soils having a stunted growth of black jack
and post oaks, such as is universally known to indicate soils too poor
for profitable cultivation. The California soil bears stunted live-oak
(<i>Q. agrifolia</i>); but not being as heavy as its brethren from
Mississippi, though unthrifty, is more readily improved.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">Comparison with the two first sandy soils in
the table on <a href="#Page_352">p. 352</a> shows, that with plant-food percentages
equal to, or even much below those here shown, not only was vigorous lime growth
present, but crop-production was good and even high.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</span>
We are thus led to the conclusion that the greater the clay percentage
in a soil, the more lime carbonate it must contain in order to possess
the advantages of a calcareous soil; and that while in sandy lands lime
growth may follow the presence of only .10% of lime, in heavy clay
soils not less than about .6% should be present to bring about the
same result. This is apparent to the eye in that the dark-tinted humus
characteristic of truly calcareous lands, does not appear in clay soils
until the lime-percentages rise to nearly 1%; while in sandy lands a
much smaller amount (say .2%) will produce this effect.</p>

in connection with preceding discussions, the estimates

<p class="blockquot fs_90">It will be observed that according to
Maercker’s valuation, the average California soil is “rich” in potash
and lime, but only “medium” as regards its contents of phosphoric
acid and nitrogen. In this respect, and almost throughout, Maercker’s
ratings are in remarkable agreement with those made by the writer as
far back as 1860.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>
It also appears that Maercker’s figures for “normal” soils correspond
to those of the American humid regions; the “arid” figures for potash
and lime being “abnormally” high.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</span>
Unfortunately neither Maercker’s method of preparing the soil extract,
nor his ratings as given in the table, are accepted by all soil
chemists even in Germany. As will be seen by reference to Wohltmann’s
work on the soils of Samoa and Kamerun (<a href="#Page_404">chap. 21, p. 404</a>),
his methods and numerical estimates differ widely from those given by Maercker,
and also from those adopted by the Prussian soil surveys. Reference
to the analyses of the soils of Madagascar by Müntz and Rousseaux,
given in the same chapter, <a href="#Page_406">page 406</a>, shows still another
different method, although as it happens their numerical estimates do not differ
very widely from those of Wohltmann. In both cases, a special, more
incisive extraction is made for the determination of potash. Why the
same more energetic action is not used for the other ingredients also,
is not stated, and is obscure. Fortunately, in all cases the action
is at least sufficiently strong to secure the dissolution of all the
lime existing in the form of carbonate, and of all, or nearly all, the
phosphoric acid not securely locked up as ferric phosphate; the latter
being inert, is of no special interest (see Analyses of Hawaiian Soils,
this chapter, <a href="#Page_256">page 256</a>).</p>

<p><i>Composition of Good Medium Soils.</i>—In the preceding tables
examples have been given of rather extreme types of soils, both rich
and poor throughout, and also of such as are deficient in one or
several of the important ingredients. In the table below are given
the analyses of some of the good average farming lands; uplands of
several states, both of the humid and arid regions. In the former, the
representative timber trees of such lands are the black, red, white and
(less characteristically) the post, black-jack, Spanish, overcup and
locally some other oaks; grading higher in proportion to the presence
of more or less hickory, and lower as the latter is replaced by pine.
In the states south of Ohio, the “oak and hickory uplands” are what the
farmer usually looks for, outside of the valleys or bottoms.</p>

<p><i>Criteria of Lands of the Two Regions.</i>—In the country west of
the Rocky Mountains, the timber, while locally very characteristic,
cannot be as broadly used as a criterion, partly on account of its
scarcity, partly because the dominant factor in the growth of trees
is <i>moisture</i>, which is measurably independent of chemical
soil-composition. The latter, moreover, on account of climatic
conditions, already alluded to (<a href="#Page_287">chapter 16</a>), does not
vary as materially in the arid as the humid region, on account of the almost
universal presence of larger proportions of lime carbonate; the
variations of which in the humid region govern largely the vegetative
changes. For we there find <i>the timber growth of the lowlands
ascending into the uplands so soon as the latter becomes decidedly
calcareous</i>; as is abundantly exemplified in the loess or “bluff”
formations bordering the Mississippi, Ohio, and Missouri rivers,
where the black walnut, tulip tree, ash, honey-locust, together with
the lowland oaks, hickories and cane usually characterizing the
stream bottoms, grow abundantly and with luxuriant development on the
adjoining steep hill country as well (see below, chapters 24, 25).

<i>Soils of the Humid Region.</i>—Taking a view, first, of the table
showing the soils of the <i>humid</i> region, it appears that the
change of vegetation from walnut and hickory to the short-leaved pine
bears no visible relation to the increase or decrease of potash or
phosphoric acid, but is plainly governed mainly by the amount of lime
present. Where the short-leaved pine prevails the soil is almost always
either neutral or shows the alkaline reaction in the course of half an
hour; but where the long-leaved pine predominates the soil has almost
always an acid reaction. The latter is also usually found in bottoms in
which the loblolly pine (<i>P. taeda</i>) prevails, and where, although
the soil may show a fair proportion of lime in the analysis, it does
not exist in the form of carbonate.</p>

<p><i>The examples here given are from lands not derived from, or
underlaid by, limestone formations.</i> Where the latter exist the
percentage of lime is usually materially increased; as it is also in
the lowlands or bottoms when compared with adjacent uplands
(<a href="#Page_162">see above, chapter 10, p. 162</a>;
<a href="#Page_331">chapter 18, p. 331</a>); as well as in the delta
lands of rivers.</p>

<p><i>Soils of the Arid Region.</i>—Even a cursory comparison of the
soils of the arid regions of the Pacific slope with those of the humid,
as given in the above tables, shows some striking points of difference.
The most obvious is the uniformly high percentage of lime, and usually
also of magnesia, in the arid soils, and that quite independently of
underlying formations, calcareous or otherwise. This occurs despite
the fact that while limestone formations are very prevalent east of
the Rocky Mountains, they are quite scarce west of the same. The red
(Laramie) sandstones of Wyoming, the slates of the foothills of the
Sierra Nevada, the clay shales, granites and eruptives of the Coast
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</span>
Ranges of California, Oregon and Washington, and the varied black rocks
of the great lava sheet of the Pacific Northwest, all alike produce
soils of high <i>lime</i> content as compared with Eastern soils not
derived from calcareous formations. This fact has already been referred
to, but is more fully illustrated in the table below.</p>

<p>Aside from the lime-content, however, it will be noted in the preceding
table that the <i>potash</i>-content of the arid soils is on the
average considerably higher than in those of the humid region. In fact
it is hard to find west of the Rocky Mountains (except where high
elevation causes a humid climate) any soils as poor in potash as are
many of the commonly cultivated lands of the Eastern United States.</p>

<p>Other ingredients do not show such marked differences from the purely
chemical standpoint: yet, as will be shown below, the forms in which
silica and alumina occur are also not inconsiderably modified.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">General Comparison of Soils from the Arid and Humid Regions of
the United States.</span><a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>—In
order to verify the conclusions just mentioned upon the broadest
basis possible, the following table has been compiled from all
available sources; partly published, partly in manuscript only, having
remained in the writer’s hands since the cessation of the Northern
Transcontinental Survey, prosecuted from 1880 to 1883, under the
auspices of the Northern Pacific Railroad, in Washington and Montana.
The published data are derived partly from the records of State
surveys, partly from the soil work connected with the Tenth Census;
partly also from those of Experiment Stations. In most cases it has
of course been necessary to restrict the comparison to such analyses
as have been made by substantially identical methods, for reasons
already given; but in the cases of some states from which numerous
analyses made by the Kedzie method, adopted by the Association of
Official Chemists, were available, the average has been given but the
name of the state starred, to indicate that the percentages, excepting
phosphoric acid, are lower than they would be if made by the method
adopted by the writer, particularly as regards potash. The adoption
of the one-millimeter mesh for the fine-earth sieve instead of the
half-millimeter size also creates an unfortunate and ineliminable
discrepancy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</span>
In order to exhibit clearly the influence of climate as distinct from
other local conditions, it was also necessary to eliminate, in both the
arid and humid regions, the soils directly derived from, or connected
with calcareous formations; such as the prairies of the Southwestern
States, the Bluegrass region of Kentucky, etc. This rule having been
applied impartially to the soils of both climatic regions, it can
hardly be questioned that the conclusions flowing from a discussion of
the results of the comparison are entitled to as much weight as are
those of any comparison based on large numbers of observations made,
not with reference to the special point under consideration, but with
a practical object of which the governing conditions were more or less
uncertain, and required to be ascertained by a process of elimination.</p>

<div class="blockquot fs_90">
<p>The table gives, first, the averages for each ingredient for each
of the states represented, the number of analyses from which the
averages are derived being given in each case. These averages are
given separately for the states of the humid and the arid regions
respectively; and at the base of each group the grand average is shown
in two forms. The first gives the figures as derived from the aggregate
number of soil analyses in each great group, being 696 for the humid,
178 for the transition region and 573 for the arid, divided into the
totals resulting from the summation of each ingredient for the whole
696, 178 and 573, respectively.</p>

<p>The second form is that in which the soils of each state are
considered as representative of the general character of such state,
as the result of intentional selection; such as actually occurred in
the cases of those included in the census work of 1880. The figures
given here are therefore the result of a summation of the <i>state
averages</i> as such, and of their division by the number of states
represented.</p>

<p>It will be noted that while these two modes of presentation do
change the figures a little, yet in either form the same general
result is outlined with striking accuracy. It is also notable that
notwithstanding the less complete extraction of soil-ingredients in the
starred (★) states, the general ratios between arid and humid soils remain
substantially the same. For Western Oregon, local calcareous formations
compel omission of three lime figures from the averages.</p>

<h4>DISCUSSION OF THE TABLE.</h4>

<p><i>Lime.</i>—Considering in this table, first, <i>lime</i>, a glance
at the columns for the two regions shows a surprising and evidently
intrinsic and material difference, approximating in the average by
totals to the proportion of 1 to 11; in the average by states, 1 to
14½. This difference is so great that no accidental errors in the
selection or analysis of the soils can to any material degree weaken
the overwhelming proof of the correctness of the inference drawn upon
theoretical grounds, viz., that the soils of the arid regions must be
richer in lime than those of the humid countries. For the differences
in derivation would, in view of the wide prevalence of limestone
formations in the humid regions concerned, produce exactly the reverse
condition of things from that which is actually found to exist; and
if further proof were needed it can readily be found in the detailed
discussion of the analyses of the soils of the arid areas forming the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</span>
contrast. This shows that for instance, in Washington highly calcareous
soils are directly derived from the black basaltic rocks; while
similarly, calcareous lands are found in California to be the outcome
of the decomposition of granites, diorites, lavas, clay-shales and
sandstones.</p>

<p>It is not easy to overrate the importance of this feature of the
soils of the arid region, as it is intimately connected with other
theoretically and practically important facts, in part already
mentioned.</p>

<p><i>Summary of Effects of Lime Carbonate in Soils.</i>—It is best
to summarize, briefly, at this point, the advantages (and possible
disadvantages), resulting from the presence of a proper amount of lime
carbonate in soils, so far as these are at present understood.</p>

<p><i>Physically</i>, even a small amount of lime carbonate, by its
solubility in the carbonated soil-water, will act most beneficially in
causing the flocculation of clay and in the subsequent conservation of
the flocculent or tilth condition, by acting as a light cement holding
the soil-crumbs together when the capillary water has evaporated;
thus favoring the penetration of both water and air, and of the roots
themselves. It should be added that according to the experience of the
writer, amounts of lime carbonate in excess of 2% do not add to the
favorable effects, except as would so much sand.</p>

<p>As to chemical effects, among the most important are:—</p>

<p>1. The maintenance of the neutrality of the soil, by the neutralization
of acids formed by the decay of organic matter, or otherwise.</p>

<p>2. The maintenance, in connection with the proper degrees of moisture
and warmth, of the conditions of abundant bacterial life (<a href="#Page_146">see above,
chapter 9, p. 146</a>); more especially those of nitrification, thus
supplying the readily assimilable form of nitrogen. Also in favoring
the development and activity of the root bacteria of legumes, and of
the other nitrogen-gathering bacteria, such as Azotobacter (<a href="#Page_156">ibid. p.
156</a>).</p>

<p>3. The rendering available, directly or indirectly, of relatively small
percentages of plant-food, notably phosphoric acid and potash; as shown
in the preceding pages.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</span></p>

<p>4. The prompt conversion of vegetable matter into black, neutral
humus, and (as shown in the case of the soils of the arid region) the
concentration of the nitrogen in the same; while accelerating the
oxidation of the carbon and hydrogen, as shown by S. W. Johnson and
others.</p>

<p>6. It counteracts the deleterious influence of an excess of magnesia
in the soil, as first shown by Loew,<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>
and verified by his pupils in Japan.</p>

<p>7. In alkali soils, according to Cameron and May, it counteracts the
injurious action of the soluble salts upon the growth of plants,
not only in the form of carbonate, but also in those of sulfate and
chlorid.<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>8. As a matter of experience, both in the case of grapes and orchard as
well as wild fruits, an adequate but not excessive supply of lime in
the soil will produce sweeter fruit than when lime is in small supply.</p>

<p>9. An excess of carbonate of lime in soils (from eight to twenty per
cent and more), constituting “marliness,” tends to seriously disturb
the nutrition and general functions of many plants (calcifuge), and to
produce a suppression or diminution of the formation of chlorophyll and
starch; as in the case of grape vines, citrus fruits and others, which
nevertheless flourish best in lands moderately calcareous.</p>

<p>Among the points thus enumerated the third and fourth require some
comment. Without pretending to define exactly how lime acts in
rendering other ingredients more available to plant assimilation,
attention may be called to the fact that lime carbonate may be
considered as acting similarly to, albeit more mildly than, caustic
lime, in the displacement of other bases from their compounds. It
doubtless acts thus in liberating potash from its zeolitic compounds.
As to phosphoric acid, the connection of the effect of lime carbonate
with the remarkable availability of that substance when present in the
form of tetra-basic salt, in the case of phosphate slag, is at least possible.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</span></p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">As to the action of lime carbonate in forming
humus,<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>
no one who has observed the characteristic dark black tint of our
calcareous “prairie soils” can question the fact; which moreover is
perfectly explicable upon the analogy already alluded to, with caustic
lime, which, together with caustic alkalies (potash and soda), is known
to act powerfully in the conversion of vegetable matter into humus.
That instead of liberating the nitrogen in the form of ammonia, as
do the caustic hydrates, the milder carbonate should only cause the
formation of humic amides, is quite intelligible. That such is really
the case, has been conclusively proved by the investigations of the
writer made conjointly with M. E. Jaffa (Rep. Sta. Cal. Agr. Expt.
1892-4); the general result being that while in the humid region the
average nitrogen-content of soil-humus is less than 5%, in the upland
soils of the arid region (where <i>all</i> soils are calcareous) that
percentage rises as high as 22.0%, with a general average of between
15 and 16%. That such highly nitrogenous material can be more readily
attacked by the nitrifying bacteria than when a large excess of other
oxidable matter is present, is at least a legitimate presumption,
especially in view of the very active nitrification known to take
place in the arid regions everywhere. So long as a large excess of
carbohydrates is present, the oxidation of these will naturally take
precedence over that of the relatively inert nitrogen. The accumulation
of the latter in the humus-substance of the arid region, where
oxidation of the organic matter of the soil is very active, points
strongly to this view of the case.</p>

<p><i>Magnesia.</i>—While the differences in respect to the proportions
of lime are the most prominent and decided, yet the related substance,
magnesia, shows also a very marked and constant difference as between
the soils of the humid and arid regions. It will be observed that the
general average for magnesia in the soils of the Atlantic Slope is
about double that of lime; Florida and Rhode Island being the only
states in which the average is lower for magnesia than for lime. In
the arid region, on the contrary, magnesia on the general average is
nearly the same as lime; in the average by states, somewhat less; thus
bringing the ratio for the two regions for magnesia up to one to six
or seven. This also is so decisive a showing that no accident could
bring it about. We must conclude that climatic influences have dealt
with magnesia similarly as with lime; which from the standpoint of
the chemist is just what might be expected, since magnesia carbonate
behaves very much like that of lime toward carbonated waters.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</span></p>

<p>That magnesia is a very important plant-food ingredient is apparent
from its invariable and rather abundant presence in the seeds of
plants, where it takes precedence of lime. Its functions in plant
nutrition have been specially investigated by O. Loew,<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>
particularly with respect to its relations to lime. As already
stated in connection with the soil-forming properties of magnesian
minerals (<a href="#Page_16">see chapter 2</a>), soils containing large proportions
of magnesia generally are found to be unthrifty, the lands so constituted
being frequently designated as “barrens.” Loew finds that certain
proportions of lime to magnesia must be preserved if production is to
be satisfactory, the proportion varying with different plants, some of
which (<i>e. g.</i> oats) will do well when the proportion of lime to
magnesia is as 1:1, while others require, that that ratio should be as
2 or 3 is to 1, to secure the best results. In general it is best that
lime should exceed magnesia in amount.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">Loew explains the injurious action of
magnesium salts thus: The calcium nucleo-proteids of the organic
structures are transformed in presence of soluble salts of magnesium
into magnesium compounds, while the calcium of the former enters into
combination with the acid of the magnesium salt. By this transformation
the capacity for imbibition will change, which must result in a fatal
disturbance of functions. The presence of soluble lime salts will
prevent that interchange. Thus certain algæ perished in a solution
containing 1 per 1000 of magnesium nitrate, but remained alive when .3
per 1000 of calcium nitrate was added.</p>

<p>Magnesia seems to be specially concerned in the transfer of phosphoric
acid through the plant tissues, in the form of dimagnesic-hydric
phosphate, which is rather soluble in the acid juices of plants. It is
probable that, apart from the relations just referred to, such excess
of lime as is known to produce chlorosis in plants interferes with the
transfer of the magnesic phosphate. Some plants, as already stated,
dispose of an excess of lime by depositing it in the form of oxalate,
while others (such as the stone crops) excrete it on the surface of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</span>
leaves and stems in the form of carbonate. But others seem to possess
this power to a limited extent only.</p>

<p>In the case of soils containing much magnesia the proper proportion
between it and lime may easily be disturbed by the greater ease with
which lime carbonate is carried away by carbonated water into the
subsoil, thus leaving the magnesia in undesirable excess in the surface
soil. Hence the great advantage of having in a soil, from the outset,
an ample proportion of lime. From this point of view alone, then, the
analytical determination of lime and magnesia in soils is of high
practical value.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">Aso, Furuta and Katayama (Bull. Coll.
Agr. Tokyo, Vol. 4 No. 5; Ibid. Vol. 6), have by direct experiment
determined the most advantageous ratio of lime to magnesia in several
crop plants. They find for rice and oats 1:1, for cabbage 2:1, for
buckwheat 3:1; there being apparently a connection between the
extent of leaf-surface and lime requirement, since leaves contain
predominantly lime, while in the fruit, magnesia predominates.</p>

<p><i>Manganese.</i>—A decided difference in the manganese content of
the arid as against the humid soils appears in the table, the ratio
being about 11:13 in favor of the humid soils. Manganese has not been
regarded as being of special importance to plant growth in general,
although, as already stated, some plants contain a relatively large
proportion of manganese in their ashes; thus, <i>e. g.</i>, the leaves
of the long-leaved pine of the cotton states.<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>
But no definite data showing the importance of this element to crops
were available until Loew and his co-workers at Tokyo<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>
established its stimulating action in a number of cases, in which crop
production was materially increased by the use of protoxid salts of
manganese. Aso<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>
applied manganous chlorid to an experimental plot of thirty square
meters, at the rate of twenty-five kilos of Mn₃O₄ per acre, and thus
obtained a yield of rice one-third greater than on the control plot, at
a cost of about $2.00, while the value of the increase of the product
was nearly $68.00. More experimental evidence on this subject is
required to establish the <i>general</i> value of the large-scale use
of the salts of manganese; which are obtained in large quantities as a
comparatively valueless by-product of the bleaching industries.

<h4><i>The “Insoluble Residue.”</i></h4>

<p>Remembering, in discussing the facts shown by the table, that the
fundamental difference between the regime of the humid and arid regions
is the presence in the latter of an almost continuous leaching process,
in which the carbonated water of the soil is the solvent; remembering,
also, that the least soluble portion of rocks and soils is quartz or
silica (sand, as usually understood), it would be predicable that this
ingredient should in the humid region be found to be more abundant in
soils than in the arid. This portion is represented by the “insoluble
residue” of the table.</p>

<p>Inspection shows that both in the averages of the single states, and in
both of the general averages, this difference between the soils of the
humid and the arid regions of the United States is strongly pronounced;
the ratio being substantially as 69% in the arid region to 84% in the humid.</p>

<p>We must then conclude that the leaching process must have influenced
materially other soil ingredients than lime, which have remained behind
in such amounts as to depress the percentage of insoluble residue in
the soils. It remains to be shown what are the substances so retained.</p>

<h4><i>Insoluble and Soluble Silica and Alumina.</i></h4>

<p>The ingredient most nearly correlated with the insoluble residue is the
free silica which remains behind with it when the acid with which the
soil has been treated is evaporated to dryness. The silica is separated
from the practically insoluble, undecomposed minerals by boiling with a
strong solution of sodic carbonate. The amount of this “soluble silica”
is obviously the measure of the extent to which the soil-silicates have
been decomposed in the treatment with acid.</p>

<p>The most prominent of these is usually supposed to be clay—the hydrous
silicate of alumina that in its purest condition forms kaolinite or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</span>
porcelain earth. Any alumina found in the usual course of soil analysis
is generally referred to this mineral, which contains silica and
alumina nearly in the proportion of 46% to 40%.</p>

<p>In very many cases, however, the reference of these two ingredients
to clay is manifestly unjustified. This is clearly so when (as not
unfrequently happens) the amount of alumina found exceeds that which
would form clay with the ascertained percentage of soluble silica; it
is almost as certainly so when, in addition to the alumina, other bases
(notably potash, lime and magnesia), are found in proportions which
preclude their being in combination with any other acidic compounds
present. The only possible inference in such cases is that these
bases, together with at least a portion of the alumina, are present in
the form of hydrated, and therefore easily decomposable silicates or zeolites.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">The subjoined analysis by R. H. Loughridge,
of a clay obtained in the usual process of mechanical soil analysis
(by precipitating with common salt the turbid water remaining after
24 hours subsidence in a column of 200 millimeters) from a very
generalized soil of northern Mississippi, shows one of the many
cases in which the numerical ratios of the several ingredients are
incompatible with the assumption that silica and alumina are present in
combination as clay (kaolinite) only:</p>

<p>If in this case we assign all alumina to silica, as required for the
composition of kaolinite or pure clay, there yet remains a trifle over
twelve (12.17) per cent of silica to be allotted to the other bases
present. Deducting from this the ascertained amount of silica soluble
in sodic carbonate, pre-existing in the raw material (.38 per cent), we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</span>
come to 11.79 per cent as the amount of silica which must have been in
combinations other than kaolinite, viz., hydrous silicates, or soil
zeolites, formed either with the bases other than alumina shown in the
analysis or, more probably, containing some of the alumina itself in
essential combination.</p>

<p>We are thus enabled to obtain from the determination of the soluble
silica an estimate of the extent to which these soil zeolites, that
form so important a portion of the soil in being the repositories of
the reserve of more or less available mineral plant-food, are present
in the soils of the several regions. A glance at the table shows that
the general average of soluble silica is very much greater in the soils
of the arid regions than in those of the humid, approximating one to
two in favor of the arid division.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>
</div>

<p><i>Differences in the Sands of the Arid and Humid Regions.</i>—In
<a href="#Page_63">chapter 5</a> mention has been made of the fact that while in
the humid regions, “sand” as a rule means quartz grains, mostly with a clean
surface and very frequently rounded and polished, in the arid regions
even the coarse sand grains consist of, or are covered with, a great
variety of minerals in a partially decomposed condition. This is
owing to the absence of the abundant rainfall which in humid climates
continually washes down the finely divided, half-decomposed mineral
matter into the subsoil; while in arid climates the light rains cannot
produce any such washing effect and hence the sand grains remain
incrusted with the products of either their own decomposition, or of
that of neighboring particles; it being therefore not concentrated
in the finer portion only, viz., the clay and finest silts. This
fundamental difference, which is illustrated in the analytical table
below, at once explains why in the arid regions generally, sandy soils
are found so highly productive that, owing to their easy cultivation
they are preferred to the clayey lands, in which tillage and irrigation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</span>
are more difficult. It is a well-known fact that on the “sands of the
desert” when either irrigated, or wetted by rain, vegetation at once
springs up with remarkable luxuriance, even on sand drifts; and this
productiveness appears to be quite as lasting as that of “strong” clay
soils of the humid regions.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">This difference is curiously illustrated
on the southern edge of the “black adobe” or prairie soil area which
surrounds Stockton, Cal. Here we find on the opposite sides of a small
stream (French Camp slough) the two extremes, of heavy clay and the
sandy soils which for many years made Stanislaus county the “banner”
county for wheat. The grain product of both banks ranked alike in
quantity and quality in average years; but in extreme seasons sometimes
one, sometimes the other failed, according to the weather conditions
which favored one or the other soil. No one would think of sowing wheat
on so sandy a soil in the humid States.</p>

<p>It thus appears that while in the Mississippi soil, solubility of
plant-food practically ceased at grain-diameter of .036 mm, in the arid
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</span>
California soils, as large an amount was found in the sand-grain sizes
between .12 and .50 millimeters as in the fine silt .016 to .025 mm. in
Mississippi.</p>

<p><i>Hydrous Silicates are More Abundant in Arid than Humid
Soils.</i>—This predominance of hydrous silicates in the soils of
the arid regions should not be a matter of surprise when we consider
the agencies which are brought to bear upon these soils with so much
greater intensity than can be the case where the solutions resulting
from the weathering process are continually removed as fast as formed,
by the continuous leaching effect of atmospheric waters. In the soils
of regions where summer rains are insignificant or wanting, these
solutions not only remain, but are concentrated by evaporation to a
point that, in the nature of the case, can never be reached in humid
climates. Prominent among these soluble ingredients are the silicates
and carbonates of the two alkalies, potash and soda. The former, when
filtered through a soil containing the carbonates of lime and magnesia,
will soon be transformed into complex silicates, in which potash takes
precedence of soda, and which, existing in a very finely divided (at
the outset in a gelatinous) condition, serve as an ever-ready reservoir
to catch and store the lingering alkalies as they are set free from
the rocks, whether in the form of soluble silicates or carbonates.
The latter have another important effect: in the concentrated form at
least, they, themselves, are effective in decomposing silicate minerals
refractory to milder agencies, such as calcic carbonate solution; and
thus the more decomposed state in which we find the soil minerals of
the arid regions is intelligible on that ground alone.</p>

<div class="blockquot fs_90">
<p>It must not be forgotten that lime carbonate, though less effective
than the corresponding alkali solutions, nevertheless is also known to
produce, by long-continued action, chemical effects similar to those
that are more quickly and energetically brought about by the action of
caustic lime. In fact, the agricultural effects of “liming” are only in
degree different from those produced by marling with finely pulverized
carbonate; and in nature the same relation is strikingly exemplified
in the peculiarly black humus that is characteristic of calcareous
lands, but which can be much more quickly formed under the influence of
caustic lime on peaty soils.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</span></p>

<p>In the analysis of silicates we employ caustic lime for the
setting-free of the alkalies and the formation of easily decomposable
silicates, by igniting the mixture; but the carbonate will slowly
produce a similar change, both in the laboratory and in the soils
in which it is constantly present. This is strikingly seen when we
contrast the analyses of calcareous clay soils of the humid region with
the corresponding non-calcareous ones of the same. In the former the
proportions of dissolved silica and alumina are almost invariably much
greater than in the latter, so far as such comparisons are practicable
without assured absolute identity of materials. That is, calcareous
clays or clay soils are so sure to yield to the analyst large
precipitates of alumina, that experience teaches him to employ smaller
amounts for analysis than he would of non-calcareous materials, in
order to avoid unmanageably large bulks of aluminic hydrate. It is but
rarely that even the heaviest non-calcareous soils yield to the acid
usually used in soil analysis more than 10 per cent of alumina; while
heavy calcareous clay (prairie) soils commonly yield between 13 and 20
per cent.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>
It would be interesting to verify this relation by artificial
digestions of one and the same clays with calcic carbonate at high
temperatures, as it must always be extremely difficult to insure
absolute identity of all other conditions in natural materials.</p>

<p>In most of these cases, what is true of alumina is also true of
the soluble silica. But since the latter is constantly liable to be
dissolved out by solutions of carbonated alkalies, it is not surprising
that this relation is not always shown.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Aluminic Hydrate.</i>—In numerous cases, the amount of alumina
dissolved in analysis is greatly in excess of the soluble silica, so as
to force the conclusion that a portion of the latter must be present in
a different form from that of clay (kaolinite); the only choice being
between that of complex hydrous silicates (none of which, however,
could contain as large a percentage of alumina as clay itself) and
<i>aluminic hydrate</i>. The latter is alone capable of explaining the
presence of more alumina than silica in easily soluble form;<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>
and the visible occurrence of “gibbsite” and “bauxite” in modern formaations
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</span>
renders this a perfectly simple and acceptable explanation. Since these
minerals are known to be incapable of crystallization, we are moreover
led to the presumption that it will as a rule be found in the finest
portions of the soil, viz., in the “clay” of mechanical analysis.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">Some illustrations of these conditions are
given below, for soils from Mississippi and California. The soluble
silica being all assigned to kaolinite, the rest of the alumina must be
assumed to be present as hydrate, since no other compound could fulfil
the stoichiometrical requirements.<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>
The table therefore shows the differences between the amounts of
alumina found by analysis, and those assignable to kaolinite,
calculated to the mineral bauxite—the most abundant, as well as the one
containing the medium proportion of water, among the three naturally
occurring aluminic hydrates.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">It is apparent from this table that if, as
is probable, the aluminic hydrate accumulates in the “clay” of the
analysis, it will in some cases form a very considerable percentage
of the same, and detract to that extent from its plastic, adhesive
and other properties. But it must be remembered that the assumption
upon which this table is calculated, leaves out of consideration the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</span>
zeolitic portion, which as the 6th column shows, is frequently quite
large as measured by the bases found, to which no other form of
combination can be assigned. Since some of the alumina undoubtedly
takes part in the formation of such zeolites, the silica must to that
extent be withdrawn from the estimate made for kaolinite. While it is
impossible to make any definite numerical allowance for this fact,
it clearly will tend in many cases to increase materially the amount
of alumina that must be assigned to the hydrate condition. It will
be noted that in most cases given, the alumina per cent is rather
large.</p>

<p>The relatively large number of such cases shown in the table for
California soils is not a matter of accident; for even a cursory glance
at the columns of analyses of California (and Washington and Montana)
soils, shows that the cases in which the alumina exceeds the silica in
amount are rather predominant, while the reverse is the case in the
humid region.<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>
But it must not be inferred that the reverse relation is not also
frequently observed even in the arid region; it occurs in fact in close
proximity to the localities where some of the most striking instances
of excess of alumina over soluble silica have been found.</p>

<div class="blockquot fs_90">
<p>Thus Nos. 861 and 863 from the neighborhood of Grass Valley, which
show this excess most strikingly, occur within 15 miles of localities
which show almost the reversal of the numbers given for the two former,
and at a level of about a thousand feet lower. It would seem, on the
whole, that the excess of alumina occurs most frequently in connection
with soils formed from eruptive rocks; in the case referred to, from
volcanic ash. It will require more detailed study to detect the causes
of these marked differences.</p>

<p><i>Retention of Soluble Silica in Alkali Soils.</i>—It is somewhat
surprising that, contrary to the expectation one would naturally
entertain, the alkali lands, so frequently rich in the carbonates of
the alkalies that would dissolve free silica, on the contrary, show
most frequently an excess of soluble silica over alumina. This is
probably to be explained from the very liberal opportunities afforded
in the alkali soils for the formation of complex zeolitic masses by the
retention in soil of the soluble alkali salts, and the abundance of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</span>
lime always present in them. As already stated, we usually find in
alkali soils a very large proportion of both alkaline and earthy bases
in acid-soluble silicate combinations. But much farther research
is needed to explain fully the marked discrepancies observed in
this respect between soils not only occurring in closely contiguous
localities, but also showing marked similarities in their general
composition.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Ferric Hydrate.</i>—There is no obvious reason, from the chemical
standpoint, why iron, that is, ferric hydrate or iron rust, should be
more abundant in the soils of the arid regions, as the averages given
in the table suggest; moreover, the fact does not impress itself upon
the eye, since the orange or reddish tints are by far more common in
the humid than in the arid regions of the United States at least.
The California average is considerably influenced by the very highly
ferruginous soils from the foothills of the Sierra Nevada, and by the
black (magnetite) sand so commonly present; that of Oregon by the
black, highly ferruginous country rock (basalts), from which they are
partly derived. The average for Montana is not higher than that of
three states of the humid region, and less than that of Kentucky. We
might imagine a cause for depletion of iron in the soils of the humid
areas in the frequency with which humid moisture and high temperature
will during the summers concur toward the bringing about of a reducing
process in the soil, which by getting the iron into proto-carbonate
solution would make it liable to be leached into the subsoil, as is
frequently the case; yet the resulting “black gravel” or bog ore, in
its various forms, is of not infrequent occurrence in the arid regions
also. A constant quantitative difference due to climatic conditions
does not appear to be shown by the data thus far at command, but the
<i>finer distribution</i> of the ferric hydrate in the humid temperate
as well tropical regions is obvious to the observer, from the frequent
redness of humid and tropical soils.</p>

<p><i>Manganese.</i>—An unexpected and apparently well-defined
contrary relation appears to be shown as regards the related metal
<i>manganese</i>; the average percentage of which is in all cases less
in the arid than in the humid region. The cause of this relation is
altogether obscure; it is too frequent to be accidental.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</span></p>

<p><i>Phosphoric Acid.</i>—As regards that highly important soil
ingredient, <i>phosphoric acid</i>, the indication in the table that
there is no characteristic difference in the average contents in soils
of the arid and humid regions, respectively, is doubtless correct.
This substance is so tenaciously retained by all soils that there is
no obvious reason why there should be any material influence exerted
upon its quantity by leaching, or by any of the differences in the
process of weathering that are known to exist between the two climatic
regions. Moreover, it is apparent that the average for the arid region
is made up out of very widely divergent figures; that of California
exceptionally low (lower than any of those for the states of the humid
regions), while those for Washington and Montana are exceptionally
high. The latter is due to country rocks (“basalts”) showing abundance
of microscopic crystals of apatite, which in some cases raise the
contents of the soils in phosphoric acid to nearly twice the average
given for the states.</p>

<p>The forecast that for most California soils, fertilization with
phosphates is of exceptional importance, has already been abundantly
confirmed by cultural experience. Few definite data are as yet
available from other arid states, where fertilization is thus far
sporadic and unsystematic. But it is predictable that in view of the
presence of an excess of lime carbonate in the arid soils, and the
unfavorable effect of this compound on the <i>rapid</i> solubility of
tri-calcic phosphate demonstrated by Schloesing, Jr.,<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>
by Böttcher and Kellner<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>
and Nagaoka,<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>
fertilization with readily available phosphate fertilizers will be
found necessary among the first, all over the arid region, especially
in view of the scarcity of humus in arid soils.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">A curious instance of the effects of
continued warm maceration in rock decomposition is afforded by the
highly ferruginous soils derived from the black basaltic lavas of the
Hawaii Islands. These lavas, like the basalt sheet of the Pacific
Northwest, contain a large amount of crystallized phosphate minerals,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</span>
notably apatite and vivianite. A correspondingly large proportion of
phosphoric acid is found in the soils derived from these rocks, up to
nearly two per cent.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>
But almost the entirety of this substance is present in the form of an
insoluble, basic iron compound, difficultly soluble even in acids, and
rendering it wholly unavailable to vegetation. So that actually the
most pressing need of most of these soils is phosphate fertilization.
The same is probably true of some of the highly ferruginous soils of
California and of the Cotton States.</p>

<p><i>Sulfuric Acid.</i>—From the absence of the leaching process in the
soils of the arid region, we should expect that sulfates would be more
abundant in them than in the soils of the humid. This is certainly
true in the case of the alkali soils, which are characteristic of the
regions of deficient rainfall. <a href="#Page_422">See below, chapter 22</a>.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">Hence the showing made in the general table,
indicating that sulfates are equally abundant in the soils of the
humid than in those of the arid regions, is surprising in view of the
efflorescences of alkali sulfates so frequently observed in the latter.
This is obviously due to the fact that the majority of such alkali
soils has, on account of their local nature and usually heavy lime
content, been excluded from the comparison; which otherwise would have
made a very different showing.</p>

<p><i>Potash and Soda.</i>—The compounds of the alkali metals potassium
and sodium, being on the whole much more soluble in water, even without
the concurrence of carbonic acid, than those of calcium and magnesium,
the leaching process that creates such pronounced differences in
the case of the two earths must affect the alkali compounds very
materially. Comparison of the soils of the two regions in this respect
shows, indeed, very great differences in the average contents of potash
and soda. For potash the ratio is .216 to .670 per cent on the general
average, and .187 to .670 per cent, in the average by states; for
soda, .140 per cent to .350 per cent on the general average, and
.110 per cent to .420 per cent in the average by states. For both,
therefore, the general average ratio is as one to between three and
four for the humid as against the arid region.</p>

<p>It is curious that an approximation to the ratio of one to two, or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</span>
somewhat less, is maintained in the average proportion of soda to
potash in both regions; but this does not by any means hold good in
detail, very high potash-percentages being often accompanied by figures
for soda very much below the above ratio. This is the result of an
important difference in the chemical behavior of the two alkalies,
which has already been alluded to in connection with the discussion of
the zeolites. (<a href="#Page_38">See chapter 3, p. 38</a>).</p>

<p>The process of “<i>kaolinization</i>,” being that by which clays are
formed out of feldspathic minerals and rocks such as granite, syenite,
trachyte, etc., results in the simultaneous formation of solutions of
carbonates and silicates of potash and soda. These coming in contact
with the corresponding compounds of lime and magnesia, also common
products of rock decomposition, are partly taken up by the latter,
forming complex, insoluble, hydrous silicates (zeolites). In these,
however, potash whenever present takes precedence of soda; so that
when a solution of a potash compound is brought in contact with a
zeolite containing much soda, the latter is partially or wholly
displaced and, being soluble, tends to be washed away by the rainfall
into the country drainage. Hence potash, fortunately for agriculture,
is tenaciously held by soils, while soda accumulates only where the
rainfall or drainage is insufficient to effect proper leaching, and
in that case manifests itself in the formation of what is popularly
known as “alkali soils;” namely those in which a notable amount of
soluble salts exists, and is kept in circulation by the alternation of
rainfall and evaporation, the latter causing the salts to accumulate
at the surface and to manifest themselves in the form of saline crusts
or efflorescenses. Alkali lands are a characteristic feature of all
regions of scanty rainfall, and are found more or less on all the
continents. The substances composing the alkali salts are retained not
only in their soluble form, but by their continued presence influence
profoundly, in several ways, the processes of soil formation. A more
detailed discussion of this important subject is given in chapters 22
and 23.</p>

<p><i>Arid Soils are Rich in Potash.</i>—One of the most important
practical conclusions flowing from the comparison of the potash
contents of the humid and arid soils respectively is that while in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</span>
former, potash is usually among the <i>first</i> substances to be
supplied by fertilization when production languishes, in the arid
regions it will as rule come <i>last</i> in order among the three
ingredients commonly so furnished. Aside from the water-soluble potash
salts always forming part of the salts of the alkali lands proper,
which in many cases will alone hold out for many years under the
demands of cultivation,<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>
they rarely contain much less than one per cent of acid-soluble potash;
occasionally rising as high as 1.8 per cent. That in such lands
potash-fertilization is uncalled-for and ineffective, hardly requires
discussion; while on the other hand, phosphates are commonly required
for full production after ten or fifteen years of cultivation without
returns. Nitrogen usually comes next in order, but sometimes is the
first need.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">The constant indiscriminate purchase and
use of all three ingredients, so urgently recommended by fertilizer
manufacturers because of their success in the humid Eastern States,
is therefore very poor economy for the farmers of the arid region.
Excepting cases of very intense culture, <i>e.g.</i> of vegetables
or berries, the use of potash salts is but rarely remunerative, and
therefore uncalled-for, in arid soils for a number of years.</p>

<p><i>Humus.</i>—The figures shown in the table for the average
humus-percentages in the soils of the two regions do not adequately
represent the very important differences actually existing; partly
because of the inadequate number of determinations made by the
same method (Grandeau’s), partly because of the differences in
the composition, and especially in the nitrogen-content of this
substance, which render direct comparison delusive. A detailed
discussion of the marked differences existing between the humus of
arid and humid soils in this respect has already been given (<a href="#Page_135">chapter
8, p. 135</a>); showing that the high nitrogen-percentage in the arid
humus probably compensates largely the lower humus-percentage,
while rendering nitrification more rapid, because the oxygen is not
consumed by overwhelming amounts of carbon and hydrogen; which, as is
already known, take precedence of nitrogen in the oxidation of humus
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</span>
substances. Nitrates are almost always more abundant in the soils of
the arid region than in those of the humid, sometimes to the extent of
influencing injuriously the quality of certain crops, such as tobacco
and sugar beets. Nevertheless, nitrogen is ordinarily, in the arid
region, the substance requiring replacement next to phosphoric acid.
And when considered in connection with the small humus-content, so
liable to burning-out, this places <i>green-manuring with leguminous
plants</i> among the first and most vital improvements to be employed there.</p>

<p><i>The Transition (semi-humid or semi-arid) Region.</i>—The sloping
plains country lying between the Rocky Mountains and the Mississippi,
quite arid at the foot of the mountains, but with rainfall increasing
more or less regularly to eastward, form a transition-belt between
the arid and humid region of which but a small portion has been
systematically studied in respect to its soil formations. The analyses
made of soils of the two adjacent states of Minnesota and North Dakota,
have been placed in the general table (<a href="#Page_377">p. 377</a>)
to show how far in their general relations their soils correspond to
the generalizations deduced from the comparison of the decidedly arid
and humid soil areas chiefly represented in the table. Although it has
not been possible, for lack of detailed data, to eliminate the soils
originating from calcareous formations, it will be seen that those of
semi-arid Dakota differ from those of more humid Minnesota, almost
throughout, as would be anticipated from the studies of the extremes,
given in this chapter.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle">SOILS OF ARID AND HUMID REGIONS<br> (<i>Continued</i>).</span></h3>
</div>

<h4>SOILS OF THE TROPICS.</h4>

<p>Within the ordinary limits of atmospheric temperatures, and in
the presence of adequate moisture, chemical processes active
in soil-formation are intensified by high and retarded by low
temperatures, all other conditions being equal. We can usually
artificially imitate, and produce in a short time by the application
of relatively high temperatures, most of the chemical changes that
naturally occur in soil-formation. While it is true that the changes
of temperature are nearly as great in the tropical as in the temperate
climates, these changes all occur at a higher level and within the
limits favoring bacterial and fungous action.</p>

<p>This being true we should expect that the soils of tropical regions
should, broadly speaking, be more highly decomposed than those of
the temperate and frigid zones, and that the intensified processes
continue currently. This fact has not been as fully verified as
might be desirable, by the direct comparative chemical examination
of corresponding soils from the several regions, owing to the want
of uniformity in methods and the fewness of such investigations in
tropical countries. Yet the incomparable luxuriance of the natural as
well as artificial vegetation in the tropics, and the long duration
of productiveness that favors so greatly the proverbial easy-going
ways and slothfulness of the population of tropical countries, offers
at least presumptive evidence of the practical correctness of this
induction.</p>

<p>In other words, the fallowing action, which in temperate regions
takes place with comparative slowness, necessitating the early use of
fertilizers on an extensive scale, is much more rapid and effective in
the hot climates of the equatorial rainy belt; thus rendering currently
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</span>
available so large a proportion of the soil’s intrinsic stores of
plant-food, that the need of artificial fertilization is there largely
restricted to those soils of which the parent rocks were exceptionally
deficient in the mineral ingredients of special importance to plants,
that ordinarily form the essential material of fertilizers. Quartzose,
magnesian, and other soils resulting from the decomposition of “simple”
rocks will, of necessity, be poor in plant-food everywhere.</p>

<p><i>Humus in Tropical soils.</i>—Another inference from the climatic
conditions of the tropics is that the <i>properly</i> tropical soils
are likely to be rich in humus, as a result of the luxuriant vegetation
which in the decay of its remnants must leave abundant humic residues.
This seems to be generally verified wherever the interval between rainy
seasons is not too long; for otherwise, under the great and constant
heat of the tropics a rapid burning-out of the humus, such as is known
to occur in the arid regions, must also take place. A good example
illustrating the inter-tropical regime as regards humus is given in the
table in <a href="#Page_137">chap. 8, p. 137</a>, showing the
humus-content of some Hawaiian soils. Both are of the same order as in
the soils of the temperate humid region, though the nitrogen-content
evidently can, consistently with productiveness, range lower than
has thus far been observed in temperate climates. This again forms a
striking contrast with the soils of the arid regions.</p>

<p>It is greatly to be regretted that not even approximate determinations
of the organic matter, much less of the humus-substance proper, have
been made by any of those who have analyzed tropical soils; excepting
those made of Hawaiian soils at the California Experiment Station.</p>

<p>The “loss by ignition” is of course always very largely water, mostly
referable to ferric hydrate and clay substance, the latter presumably
essentially in the form of kaolinite. When, therefore, ferric oxid and
alumina have been determined, we may approximate to the amount of total
organic matter by making allowance for ferric hydrate at the rate of
about 14% of the ferric oxid, for kaolinite at that of 34.92% of the
alumina found. Deducting these amounts of water from the total “loss by
ignition,” we may obtain at least an approximate idea of the organic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</span>
matter, and the probable availability of the nitrogen determined by the
analysis. <a href="#Page_357">See chapter 19, p. 357</a>.</p>

<p>While the continuous heat and moisture of the tropics concur toward
rapid rock decomposition, it must be remembered that the copious
rainfall is equally conducive to an <i>intense leaching effect</i>.
Striking examples of this action occur in the Hawaiian Islands, in
the highly ferruginous soils resulting from the decomposition of the
black (pyroxenic and hornblendic) lavas that are so characteristic
of the volcanic effusions of that region. The soils formed from
these rocks are sometimes so rich in ferric hydrate (iron rust)
that they might well serve as iron ores elsewhere. But these soils
are very unretentive, and though very productive at first they are
soon exhausted, the abundant rains having sometimes deprived them of
almost every vestige of lime, and of most of the potash contained in
the original rock. At the same time the abundant phosphoric acid of
the original rock has been reduced to almost total unavailability by
combination with ferric oxid, just as in the case of the bog ore of the
temperate climates; so that phosphate fertilization is urgently needed
in these lands, though showing high percentage of phosphoric acid.
(<a href="#Page_356">Chap. 19, p. 356</a>.)</p>

<p>Soils highly colored by ferric hydrate occur rather frequently in
the tropics, and have received the general name of “laterite” soils.
Curiously enough, the intense reddish tint mostly shown in these soils,
and which is emphasized in the “terra roxa” of the Brazilians, and
the general “red” aspect of Madagascar, and of the Malabar and Bengal
coasts, is by no means always accompanied by markedly high percentages
of iron oxid; but the latter is very finely diffused, so as to be very
effective in coloration. The plant-food percentages of tropical soils
are generally quite low, so that in the temperate humid regions such
lands would be adjudged to be rather poor. Yet they mostly prove quite
productive and lasting, even without fertilization.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">This is doubtless to be explained by
the continuous and rapid rock and soil-decomposition which goes on
under tropical climatic conditions, already alluded to; so as to
supply enough available plant-food for the demands of each season’s
vegetation, analogously to the proverbial “nimble penny.” This is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</span>
supplemented also by the rapid decay and leaching-out of the ash
ingredients of the rapidly decaying and dying vegetation. Nitrification
must likewise, of course, be very active under the continual heat and
moisture, and the humus formed under these circumstances is likely to
be quite poor in nitrogen. On this latter point, however, definite data
are almost wholly wanting.</p>

<p><i>Investigations of Tropical Soils.</i>—The most extended chemical
investigations of properly tropical soils have been made by Wohltmann
in his investigations of the soils of India, German Southwest and
Southeast Africa, and Samoa;<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>
and by Müntz and Rousseaux of soils collected under Government auspices
in Madagascar. Leather, Bamber and Mann have also analyzed a large
number of soils of India. But we find in many of these cases a failure
to specify distinctly the local climatic conditions, and even the depth
to which the samples have been taken; so that the investigator is
obliged to examine laboriously the local climates, and especially the
amount and distribution of rainfall, before being enabled to discuss
intelligently the data given. Even Wohltmann, in his discussion of
North African and Saharan soils, classes these distinctly arid types
among the tropical ones.</p>

<p>Again, the dry seasons intervening between the tropical rains, varying
in length and from locality to locality, obscure somewhat the relations
of the soils to the climatic conditions. Under the lee of mountains,
even of slight altitude, we find xerophytic (arid-land) vegetation,
as has been noted by many observers in Brazil, even near the Amazon;
in Hawaii, in Jamaica, and in Madagascar. Unless, therefore, a close
discrimination is exercised by field observers, many contradictory
results will appear in analyses of soils of inter-tropical countries.
This is naturally the case in India, where the topographic surface
conformation and seasonal climatic conditions are so complicated and
contrasted. On the whole, the results obtained in Samoa, Kamerun and
Madagascar seem, of those available, to be the most characteristic of
true tropical conditions. In comparing these with the soils of low
plant-food percentages in the temperate humid region (<a href="#Page_352">see chapter 19,
p. 352</a>), it must be remembered that those mentioned as being productive
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</span>
are so by virtue of great depth and relatively high proportions of
lime; while in the tropics, the intense leaching process prevents
lime from reaching any high absolute or relative percentages, save
where limestone formations prevail. Moreover, the mode of preparation
of the soil extracts for analysis by Wohltmann, and by Müntz and
Rousseaux, differ so widely from that forming the basis of discussion
of soil-composition in this volume, that it becomes necessary to make
separate allowances in each case; since some of the ingredients,
phosphoric acid, lime and magnesia, are fully dissolved by the weaker
treatments, while others,—<i>e. g.</i>, potash—are not, and are
therefore not directly comparable with the data obtained in the
writer’s work. The analyses made in India by Leather and others have
apparently been made substantially in accordance with the author’s
methods and may be considered directly comparable.</p>

<h4>SOILS OF SAMOA AND KAMERUN.</h4>

<p>Wohltmann has investigated the soils of Samoa, notably
those of the main island of Upolu, under the auspices of the
German “Kolonial-Wirthschaftliche Komitee” in 1903, and
gives the results of his observations and analyses in a report
published at Berlin in 1904. The analyses are quite numerous,
but unfortunately are made by a special method which renders
them only partly comparable with those of any other analyst.</p>

<div class="blockquot fs_90">
<p>Wohltmann’s method is this: “450 grams of fine earth (below 2
millimeters diameter) is treated for 48 hours with 1½ liters of cold
chlorhydric acid of 1.15 density. Another portion, designed for a
fuller determination of potash, is treated for one hour with the same
acid, boiling hot. Potash was determined in both soil extracts; the hot
extract gave from one-third to twice the amount obtained in the cold
extraction.”<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>Wohltmann justifies this method by the statement that it has yielded
him results more nearly in accord with experience than any other tried,
both with tropical and European soils.</p>

<p>Under these conditions only a few of the determinations in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</span>
Wohltmann’s analyses are directly comparable with those upon which the
discussions in this volume have been based. The figures for nitrogen
and phosphoric acid may be assumed to be fully comparable; that of
lime will in general represent fully only that which is present in the
forms of carbonate, sulfate and humate, and a part of that existing in
zeolitic or hydrous silicate form. Of the two potash determinations
only the one made in hot extraction will be even remotely comparable,
being probably at least 30% lower than would have been obtained by the
writer’s method.</p>
</div>

<p>Even thus, however, Wohltmann’s results are highly instructive. He
gives the following summary of his mode of interpreting such analyses:</p>

</table>

<p>It will be observed that the figures of this table differ materially
only in the matter of potash from those given in <a href="#Page_354">chapter 19, p. 354</a>;
for the latter substance they would have to be multiplied by from 2 to
4, according to the lime-content and other conditions.</p>

<p>With this understanding a number of Wohltmann’s analyses of soils from
Samoa and Kamerun are given below, the potash determinations made with
hot acid being placed in parentheses after the other.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90"><i>Soils of Samoan Islands.</i>—A discussion
of these analyses shows, from the writer’s point of view, a very low
content of potash and lime, with the peculiarity that both are somewhat
higher at the depth of a meter than in the surface ten-inches. This
is probably to be accounted for from the very high content of organic
matter (humus), which is apparent from the high “loss by ignition,”
a very large proportion of which must be credited to the burning of
the organic matter. That this humus reaches to the lowest depths
examined, is clear from the nitrogen-content given for these samples.
Wohltmann, whose estimate of these soils agrees in most respects with
the writer’s, attributed to them a very satisfactory nitrogen-content.
This would be true of the total; but as he has not determined either
the true humus or its nitrogen-content, it remains uncertain whether
or not a sufficiency is in an available form, and whether their case
may not be like that of the Hawaiian soil mentioned above (<a href="#Page_362">chapter 19,
p. 362</a>), in which despite 10% of humus and .17% of nitrogen, the land
was found to be nitrogen-hungry. Again, as regards the phosphoric acid,
which Wohltmann considers satisfactory to high, it is questionable to
what extent it is rendered unavailable by the very high content of
ferric hydrate. We are thus left in some uncertainty as to the real
manurial requirements of the Samoan soils, which doubtless represent
very closely also those of Tutuila, the chief American island of the group.

<div class="blockquot fs_90">
<p>It is probable that for crops requiring so much potash as do the
banana and cacao trees, potash is the first need when they cease to
produce well on these soils.</p>

<p><i>Soils of Kamerun.</i>—In the soils of Kamerun, also analyzed by
Wohltmann, and of which two are placed alongside of those of Samoa, it
is at once seen that the materials from which they have been formed are
richer in both potash and lime than the parent rocks of the Samoan, and
not quite so rich in iron. They are also very rich in organic matter,
evidently down to the depth of a meter, as are those of Samoa. It is
probably due to the high humus-content that these soils, washed as they
have been by the second-highest rainfall in the world (about 35 feet
annually) have not been as thoroughly leached as have been those of
the Brahmaputra valley. The annual rainfall of Samoa is only from nine
to eleven feet on the lower levels, but ranges as high as 18 feet at
higher elevations.</p>
</div>

<p>It is noticeable that in most of these true tropical soils the content
of magnesia is considerably above that of lime; a fact readily
intelligible from the more ready solubility of lime in carbonated
water. It is hardly doubtful that this disproportion will in many cases
explain a lack of thriftiness, which could be effectually remedied by
a simple application of lime or marl, without resorting to the more
costly fertilizers.</p>

<h4>THE SOILS OF MADAGASCAR.</h4>

<p>The soils of the island of Madagascar have been analyzed to the number
of about 500 by Müntz and Rousseaux, under the auspices of the French
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</span>
government.<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>
So large a number of analyses should give a very full understanding of
the agricultural capacity and adaptation of so comparatively limited
an area; unfortunately, we are here again confronted by more or less
imperfect data accompanying the samples collected by government agents,
and by the use of an analytical method different from those of all
other nations, and hence incommensurable except, as in the case of
Wohltmann’s method, in regard to certain ingredients.</p>

<p>The French chemists use nitric instead of chlorhydric acid; cold for
phosphoric acid and lime, boiling-hot for five hours for potash;
considering the remainder as of no practical importance. Since nitric
acid is in general much less incisive than chlorhydric in its solvent
power, comparison with the analyses made by other nations becomes
difficult. As in the case of Wohltmann, magnesia, lime, and phosphoric
acid may be considered to be quite thoroughly extracted by the
treatment; while extraction of possibly available potash is doubtless
very incomplete. On the whole, however, the estimates of soil-fertility
based on percentages is very nearly the same as those assigned by
Wohltmann in the table given above. Like Wohltmann, they emphasize the
axiom that the same percentage-gauge of fertility cannot be applied in
the tropics as in the temperate zones.</p>

<p><i>General Character of the Island.</i>—The island of Madagascar,
lying between the 11th and 25th degrees of south latitude, is quite
mountainous in its central and eastern portion, where the coast falls
off pretty steeply into the sea, leaving only a narrow coast belt of
properly agricultural land in the lower valleys and at the mouth of
the torrential streams. The mountains rise at one point to the height
of nearly 10,000 feet. The western portion of the Island is much less
broken, has much plateau land with low intersecting ranges and streams
of moderate fall, with considerable alluvial lands near the coast.
The rocks are almost throughout gneisses and mica-schists, which, as
heretofore stated (<a href="#Page_51">chapter 4, p. 51</a>), form mostly
poor soils. There are a few areas of eruptive rocks and tertiary
calcareous deposits, and on these the lands are much more thrifty. The
rocks and red soils of the central mass, however, extend seaward almost
everywhere.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</span></p>

<p>The rainfall is high on the east side, where the moisture of the
southeast trade winds is first condensed, the precipitation reaching
ten to twelve feet (120 to 144 inches) annually. The western portion
is relatively dry, but rains fall more or less throughout the year;
while in the eastern and central mountainous part there is a distinct
subdivision into a wet and a dry season. Here, while the rivers are
largely torrential, many large fertile valleys have been created by the
heavy denudation of the mountain slopes. This is especially the case in
the Imerina province (in which the capital, Tananarivo, is situated),
and here the valley soils are deep, and rich in humus. The western
portion is but thinly forested. The soils of most of the island are
“red” with ferric hydrate, resembling the laterite soils elsewhere; yet
the iron percentages are not usually very heavy, ranging mostly from
4 to 6, more rarely to 10% and more, of ferric oxid. Most of the red
soils are clayey, crack open in summer and become very hard in drying.</p>

<p>Of the 476 soils analyzed by Müntz and Rousseaux, 156 are from the
province of Imerina, 56 from the adjacent province of Betsileo,
therefore 212 from the central, mountainous part of the island. The
remainder are scattered around the coasts; the most productive being
apparently those of the northern end, Diego Suarez, which is mostly
underlaid by the eruptive rocks forming the mountain mass of Mount
Amber, from which numerous fertile valleys radiate. The valleys of the
west coast also, in the provinces of Bara, Tulear and Betsiriry, have
some very productive soils.</p>

<p>The subjoined table, giving fourteen analyses selected as
representative from the mass of material presented by Müntz and
Rousseaux, gives a fair general idea of the character of the soils
of the great island. It is at once apparent that lime and potash are
extremely deficient in the soils of the mountain slopes of central and
southern Madagascar, these substances having, as elsewhere in the humid
region, been leached down into the valleys; and the materials being
mostly quite clayey, these valley soils have not, as in the case of the
sandy alluvium of the Brahmaputra, themselves been again leached of
their mineral ingredients. Practically these valleys seem to form the
only profitably cultivable area of the central portion; while along
the larger river courses, such as the Mangoky, Ikopa, Mahajamba and
others, good alluvial “bottoms” and deltas form available lands. It
seems to the writer that, in view of their own expressed opinion that
tropical soils are not to be gauged on the same percentage-basis of
soil-ingredients as those of temperate regions, Müntz and Rousseaux
rather underestimate the productive value of many of these lands;
regarding which the field notes report good production, and the crops
of which are certainly not the first that they have borne in the course
of Malagassy history. It is as though their anxiety to forestall
overestimates of agricultural prospects by intending settlers, had led
them to somewhat overshoot the mark.

Be that as it may, the influence of the tropical climate and rainfall
upon the composition of these soils is certainly very marked. While
gneiss is not credited with producing first-class soils, its usual
content of orthoclase feldspar should at least insure a respectable
average content of potash; but this, it will be seen, is mostly not the
case; and that of lime seems even worse, aside from the case where,
as in some regions near the coast (especially in the west and south),
calcareous formations, probably of tertiary age, have contributed to
soil-formation. At some points there seem to exist phosphate deposits,
well known elsewhere to occur in such rocks, which impart to the soils
exceptionally high percentages of phosphoric acid, even exceeding one
per cent. The phosphates of course remain practically untouched by the
leaching processes, and appear to be somewhat widely diffused; so that
the soils of Madagascar may be said to be, on the whole, well supplied
with this important plant-food.</p>

<p>In the central province of Imerina the valleys and lower slopes show a
fair content of both lime and potash; but in the province of Betsileo,
adjoining it on the south, nearly every one of the soils analyzed is
reported as containing only “traces” of lime, together with very small
amounts of potash in most cases. The ultimate analyses of ignited red earths,
of which an average is here given, are of interest in this connection.</p>

It is quite obvious that only leaching-down and concentration of the
feeble resources of such material in the valleys can produce soils
worthy of permanent cultivation.</p>

<p>One point, however, is strikingly illustrated in several of the
analyses given in the subjoined table. We find in the original quite a
number of cases in which the field notes report considerable fertility,
while the chemists’ judgment is very unfavorable. Thus we find recorded
for the soil No. 267, taken near the village of Anjozorabe, in the
Maintirano region, “luxuriant vegetation and remarkable crops,” with
such minute proportions of potash, lime and phosphoric acid that
the authors are compelled to say that the land offers “no cultural
resources.” The same occurs in the cases of soils Nos. 370, 261,
and several others having either “good crops” or “abundant natural
vegetation.” Unless we assume that in these cases the samples were
not properly taken, we are obliged to conclude that under the local
climatic conditions, such minute amounts of plant-food are developed
with sufficient rapidity to supply good growth. This would be quite
parallel to the case of the tea soils of Assam, whose production lasted
30 years before showing exhaustion, on plant-food percentages only
slightly greater than those here noted, and determined by a much more
incisive method.</p>

<p>It is thus quite obvious that a different standard of interpretation
must be applied to tropical soils as compared with either the temperate
humid, or the arid regions; and that uniform methods of analysis are
needed to evolve a definite rule from the present uncertainties.</p>

<h4>THE SOILS OF INDIA.</h4>

<p>The soils of India have been investigated to some extent by the
geological survey of India; by Voelcker, who went there on a special
mission to investigate agricultural conditions; and since, more
especially by Leather, Bamber and Mann; and by Moreland. Leather’s
account is the most complete on the general subject and can best serve
as the basis for a review of the entire peninsula.<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</span>
According to Dr. Leather, “the four main types of soils to be dealt
with, and which certainly occupy by far the larger of the Indian
cultivated area,” are: <i>The Indo-Gangetic alluvium</i>, covering
the chief cultivable areas of the Indo-Gangetic plain; the <i>black
cotton soils or regur</i>, occupying the main body of the plateau
of the Central provinces (the Deccan) from the Vindhya range south;
the <i>red soils</i> lying on the metamorphic rocks of Madras; and
the “<i>laterite</i>” <i>soils</i> which are met with in many parts
of India. To these should be added the <i>alluvial soils of the
Brahmaputra valley</i>, in Assam. It is hardly to be expected that so
large an area as that of India, with its diversified topography, and
a climate ranging from about four inches of rainfall in the northern
Panjab to the world’s maximum in Assam, and southward to typical
tropical conditions, could be even thus briefly characterized. The
observers have rarely given for the several soils analyzed, special
local and climatic data, which cannot always be obtained from the
official publications; so that it is not easy to discuss them from the
points of view of aridity and humidity.</p>

<p><i>The Indo-Gangetic Plain.</i>—The general rain-map of India shows
the Panjab and Rajputana to be arid throughout; thence eastward the
rainfall increases to 25 and 30 inches on the Ganges; notwithstanding
which, alkali (reh) is abundant about Aligarh, Meerut and Agra. Thence
toward Calcutta there is a steady increase of rainfall until, at the
head of the Bay of Bengal, 70 inches is reached.</p>

<p>If under these conditions the Indo-Gangetic plain admits of any
generalizations as regards soil composition, it must be attributed in
the main to its predominantly alluvial character. It should therefore
be relatively rich in lime, magnesia and potash. So far as the first
is concerned, Leather remarks that the only rocky particles larger
than sand to be found in all this large belt of land is the nodular
limestone called kankar, formed by the deposition of calcium carbonate
within the soil, at the depth of a few feet. It occurs very generally
in India, and as stated above (chapters 9 and 19), this occurrence
of calcareous hardpan, of varying hardness, is almost universal
in the arid regions. The analysis given in the table, selected as
representative from those given by Leather, show that the general
forecast is realized in them, as soils of an arid region.

<i>The Brahmaputra Alluvium in Assam.</i>—Aside from the immediate
alluvium of the Indus, of which no definite data are available, the
Indo-Gangetic plain represents the drainage of the <i>southern</i>
slope of the Himalaya chain. That of most of the <i>northern</i>
slope is represented by the Brahmaputra, which not only originates
in a region of heavy precipitation—Thibet—but continues in the
same throughout its course, and rounding the easternmost spur of the
Himalaya range enters, in southern Assam, upon the region of the
maximum rainfall known. Its alluvial deposits should therefore show
the reverse characteristics of those of the Ganges; they should, as
thoroughly leached soils, be poor in lime, magnesia and potash. We
have fortunately on this subject the excellent work done by Mr. H. H.
Mann for the Indian Tea Association, the report of which was published
in 1901, and contains, besides a large number of analyses, good
descriptions of the general soil and cultural conditions of the Assam
tea districts, with suggestions for their improvement.</p>

<p>The tea plantations of Assam are located almost wholly on the new and
old alluvium of the Brahmaputra river, bordered on the north by the
eastern spur of the Himalayas, on the south by the low ranges of the
Khasia hills. The soil is mostly quite sandy, the late alluvium gray in
color, the older reddish and more loamy. Of the four analyses given in
the table and fairly representing the average character of these soils,
the two first are from the north side, the latter two from the south
side of the river.</p>

<p>It will be noted that the prominent feature of all these soils is an
extremely low percentage of lime, the general average being about .08%
as against nearly 1.0% in the average Indo-Gangetic soils. In the
latter, potash ranges between .65 and .70%; in the Assam soils between
.25 and .35. Magnesia averages nearly 1.3 in the Indo-Gangetic, against
about .50 in the Assam tea soils. It is thus apparent that the same
general facts as regards the leaching-out of soil ingredients already
shown for eastern and western North America are strikingly verified in
northern India; but reversed as regards the points of the compass. The
preferential leaching-out of lime as compared with magnesia and potash,
is here again well exemplified. It would be interesting to have an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</span>
analysis of the Brahmaputra water to compare with that of the Ganges.
That tea should flourish for twenty to thirty years in such soils,
is a good indication of one cause at least of the total failure of
tea culture in California, where tea plants are difficult to maintain
alive, and after 25 years form rounded, scrubby bushes not over four
feet high. Similar failures of tea on calcareous soils are on record
from India. The low lime-content of the Assam soils, then, does not
necessarily imply that these soils should be limed to maintain tea
production. According to Mann, the main deficiency is in nitrogen, as
the figures imply; but whether his recommendation of green-manuring
with leguminous crops to increase the nitrogen-supply is practicable
without first supplying more lime to the Assam soils, is questionable.
Since phosphoric acid is also low, his recommendation to use freely the
basic or Thomas slag is doubtless a good one, since lime would thus
also be moderately increased.</p>

<p>Bamber gives a number of analyses of tea soils from low ground in
Assam, which are very rich in vegetable matter and quite acid. Like
those reported by Leather, these “bhil” soils are very poor in lime and
nitrogen, but fairly supplied with potash and phosphoric acid.</p>

<p><i>The Regur or Black Cotton Soils of Southern India.</i>—The
second-greatest reasonably uniform soil-area of India is that covered
by the regur, or black cotton soils, in south central India, notably
the Deccan, where these soils are said to have been cultivated without
fertilization for 2000 years and are still fairly productive.<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>
Both in their physical character, chemical composition, and cultural
characteristics, these regur soils are very similar to the “prairie
soils” of the Cotton states and especially to the “black adobe” of
California. Like the latter they are of unusual depth without change of
tint; they crack wide open during the dry season on account of their
high clay content; and the soil is thus partly inverted by the surface
soil falling into the cracks. To the latter fact Leather ascribes, in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</span>
part, the long duration of fertility in the regur lands. The regur also
contains fragments of calcareous hardpan (here called guvarayi), just
as in the Great Valley of California. The eighteen analyses of regur
given by Leather agree so nearly in their essential points that it is
admissible to average them; two other examples are however also given
in the table.</p>

<p>It will be noted that while the contents of lime, magnesia and alumina
are uniformly high, the content of potash has a wide range; it rises
very high (1.14%) in the maximum, while the average is fair.</p>

<p>One conspicuous defect of these soils is their extremely low
content of nitrogen, in view of which their lasting productiveness
is difficult to understand; unless it be that, as in California,
their high lime-content causes a copious crop of leguminous weeds,
constantly replacing the nitrogen supply.<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>
Unfortunately we have no determinations of humus or of its
nitrogen-content. Leather attributes the black color of the regur to
some mineral substance rather than to humus; but his arguments are not
quite convincing, so long as the Grandeau test has not been made. In
view of the low rainfall and the closeness of the texture of regur, it
is probable that little if any nitrates are currently washed out of the
black cotton lands.</p>

<p>The regur soil-sheet seems to be underlaid over the greater part of its
area by a basaltic eruptive sheet (not by metamorphic rocks, as stated
by Leather), and it is not easy to conceive how such a soil stratum can
have been formed from such rocks as a sedentary formation. Elsewhere
such soils are usually rather light and porous, as is the case in the
Hawaiian and Samoan islands; and very high in iron-content. The regur
has the character of an alluvial backwater or lake deposit; but how
such a formation can have occurred on the Deccan plateau, is a question
not easily answered.</p>

<p><i>Red Soils of the Madras Region.</i>—Interspersed with and to
seaward of the regur lands there are in the Madras presidency
considerable bodies of “red” lands, which appear to be sedentary soils
formed from underlying dark-colored, mostly eruptive rocks. Some of
these are very rich in lime and potash, others very poor, and it seems
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</span>
impossible to classify them under any definite category either from the
chemical or physical point of view, except as to their red tint. Even
this tint, however, is not always found associated with exceptionally
high contents of iron oxid, but due rather to its fine diffusion in the
soil mass. As compared with the regur, with which the “red ” areas are
interspersed, these soils contain, on the average, less lime, potash
and ferric oxid; and phosphoric acid is uniformly low. The alluvial
(brown and black) soils from the same region, exemplified in the table,
are doubtless derived partly from the regur, and their color and
composition varies accordingly.</p>

<p>“<i>Laterite Soils.</i>”—These are defined by Wohltmann (Tropische
Agricultur, 1892) as being “the characteristic sedentary soils
(Verwitterungsböden) of the tropics, formed under the influence of
heavy precipitation, high temperatures and drought.” This definition
does not indicate their derivation from any particular rock, such as
laterite is supposed to be; but its definition puzzles even geologists,
and so, as Leather observes, the definition of laterite soils will
naturally puzzle agricultural chemists. Accordingly it is difficult to
deduce from the analyses given any definite common characters. Leather
describes those analyzed by him as red or reddish, sandy and gravelly,
the gravel or cobbles often incrusted with a dark-smooth crust of
limonite, which to the uninitiated looks as though the rock itself had
been fused and vitrified. The samples from Lohardaga and Singhbhum show
the effects of these limonite crusts upon the composition of the soils,
which resembles that of the Hawaiian soils mentioned above; but in the
latter the iron oxid is wholly pulverulent. But it is probable that, as
in the case of the latter, the high content of phosphoric acid shown in
the statement (.64 for the Lohardaga soil) is tightly locked up in the
insoluble form of ferric phosphate. Wohltmann’s definition of laterite
soils seems best represented by the “terra roxa” of Brazil, which as he
states has .02 to.08% of potash, .02 to.10% of lime, and .045 to .10% of
phosphoric acid. Humus and nitrogen are very deficient in all these soils.</p>

<p>While most prominent in the coast region of Bengal, they also occur not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</span>
only near Madras (Saidapet) but also in the belt of high rainfall on
the Malabar (western) coast of the Indian peninsula.</p>

<p>The productiveness of the laterite soils seems throughout to be only
moderate, yet much higher than would be expected of soils of similar
composition in the temperate zones, where the rate of soil-formation is
so much slower than in the tropics.</p>

<p>From the analyses of “coffee soils” from Yarcand in the Sheveroy hills,
north of Madras, we learn that coffee does well with a fairly liberal
supply of lime (.30 to.44%) and phosphoric acid, but is satisfied with
a much smaller amount of potash than is found in the tea soils of Assam.</p>

<p>A farther systematic investigation of the soils of India, with
simultaneous accurate observations on their depth, subsoil, geological
derivation, topographical location and relations to rainfall, could
not fail to yield very important practical results. The examination of
samples collected and sent in by persons unfamiliar with the proper
mode of taking soil specimens, and the information which should
accompany them, always involves a great deal of uncertainty and waste
of labor, and indefiniteness of results.</p>

<h4>INFLUENCE OF ARIDITY UPON CIVILIZATION.</h4>

<p>In connection with the facts given and discussed above, as to the
relative productive capacity of lands of the humid and arid regions,
it becomes of interest to consider what influence, if any, these
differences may have had in determining the choice of the majority of
the ancient civilizations in favor of countries where nature imposes
upon the husbandman, who supplies the prime necessaries of life, the
onerous condition of artificial irrigation.<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p><i>Preference of Ancient Civilizations for Arid Countries.</i>—A brief
review suffices to establish the fact of such choice. Aside from Egypt,
the permanent fertility of which is ascribed to the inundations of the
Nile, we find to westward the oases of the Libyan and Sahara deserts,
the high fertility of which has become proverbial and has caused them
to be cultivated from ancient times to the present. Similarly, on both
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</span>
sides of the Mediterranean Sea, we find that, instead of the humid forest
country, it was in the arid but irrigable coast countries, such as
the vegas of Valencia, Alicante, Granada, Malaga, and the even more
arid domain of which Carthage was the metropolis; and farther east,
in the Graeco-Syrian archipelago and the adjacent coasts, that noted
centers of civilization were developed and maintained. Thence the arid
belt requiring irrigation extends from Egypt and Arabia to Palestine,
Syria, Assyria, Mesopotamia and Persia, and across the Indus through
the anciently recognized regions of Indian civilization—Sindh, the
Panjab, Rajputana and the Northwestern provinces—to the Ganges,
embracing such well-known centers as Lahore, Delhi, Meerut, Agra,
etc., inhabited by much more hardy and progressive races than the
humid and highly productive tropical portions of the Indian peninsula.
Throughout the extensive and important portion of northern India,
irrigation is necessary to maintain regular production; and in default
of it, periodic famines ravage the country. Thousands of years ago,
millions upon millions of treasure were expended there upon irrigation
works, as has again been done in modern times; yet in the rainy,
forested districts we still find large areas practically tenanted by
wild beasts. In Asia Minor, as well as in Central Asia, the remains of
ancient cities once surrounded by richly productive irrigated fields,
are found where at present only the herds of nomads pasture. The
Khanates of southern Turkestan with their historic cities, illustrate
the same obstinate bias in favor of arid climates. Similarly, in the
New World, it was not in the moist and exuberantly fertile forest lands
of the Orinoco and Amazon, but on the arid western slopes of the Andes,
that the civilization of the Incas was developed. In Mexico, also, it
was the high central, arid plateau, not the bountifully productive
<i>tierra caliente</i>, over which the Aztecs chose to establish the
main centers of their empire. Even to northward, the inhabitants of the
high, dry plains of Arizona and New Mexico were, as their descendants
of the Pueblos are to-day, superior in social development to their
forest-dwelling neighbors of the Algonquin race. From time immemorial
they have practiced irrigation in connection with cultivation,
maintaining a comparatively dense population on very limited areas.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</span></p>

<p>It might be thought that the desire to avoid the labor of clearing the
forest ground was the motive which guided the choice of the ancient
nations toward the cheerless-looking, treeless regions.</p>

<p>But if we consider the cost and labor of establishing and maintaining
irrigation ditches, it certainly seems that a stronger motive, based on
the intrinsic nature of the case, must have influenced their selection.
Neither can we with any degree of plausibility ascribe the preference
for the arid open country to the fear of enemies lurking in the forest,
since war was in early times practically the normal condition of
mankind, and was waged with little hesitation wherever booty was in
sight. It has also been asked how the ancients could have known of the
high productive capacity of arid lands; but no one who has ever seen
the springing-up of luxuriant vegetation after the periodic overflows
of the arid-region streams, or the same surrounding the springs in the
deserts, would ask that question.</p>

<p><i>Irrigation necessitates Co-operation.</i>—Irrigation enterprises
can be accomplished in a very limited degree only by individuals
or even families. Its permanently successful execution requires
the co-operation of at least several social groups, ultimately of
communities and states, if it is not to give rise to acrimonious
contentions or actual warfare; witness the “shotgun policy” resorted to
in the arid West in times not very remote. Irrigation, in other words,
compels co-operative social organization quite different from and far
in advance of that necessary in humid countries. And such organization
is manifestly conducive to the preservation and development of the arts
of peace, which means civilization. The most ancient systematic code of
laws known to us is that of Hammurabi, the king of arid Assyria.</p>

<p><i>The high and permanent productiveness of arid soils induces
permanence of civil organization.</i>—In humid countries, as is
well known, cultivation can only in exceptional cases be continued
profitably for many years without fertilization. But fertilization
requires a somewhat protracted development of agriculture to be
rationally and successfully applied in the humid regions, and the
Germanic tribes, like the North-American Indians, seem to have shifted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</span>
their culture grounds frequently in their migrations. No such need was
felt by the inhabitants of the arid regions for centuries, for the
native fertility of their soils, coupled with the fertilizing effects
of irrigation water bringing plant-food from afar, relieved them of
the need of continuous fertilization; while in the humid regions, the
fertility of the land is currently carried into the sea by the drainage
waters, through the streams and rivers, causing a chronic depletion
which has to be made up for by artificial and costly means. What with
the greater intrinsic fertility and the great depth of soil available
for plant growth, much smaller units of land will suffice for the
maintenance of a family in arid countries; a fact which is even now
being illustrated in the irrigated region of the United States, where
ten acres of irrigated land instead of 40 or 160, as in the East, form
the unit.</p>

<p>The arid regions were, therefore, specially conducive to the
establishment of the highly complex polities and high culture, of
which the vestiges are now being unearthed in what we are in the habit
of calling “deserts;” the very sands of which usually need only the
life-giving effects of water to transform them into fruitful fields
and gardens. It is also quite natural that the wealthy and prosperous
communities so formed should in the course of time have excited the
cupidity of the “barbarous” forest-inhabiting races, and as history
records, have been over and again overwhelmed by them—a similar fate
often afterwards overtaking the conquerors in their turn, after the
Capuan ease of their existence had weakened their warlike prowess. At
the present time, the arid regions of the old world are still largely
suffering from having been overrun by the nomadic Turanians, whose
original habitat—Mongolia and Turkestan—while also arid, does not
permit of the ready realization of the advantages above outlined, on
account of the rigorous climate brought about by altitude. Mahometanism
first expelled, and has since repelled, occidental civilization from
the arid regions of the Old World, remaining to-day as an obstacle
to its progress. The peaceful aggression of railroads and telegraphs
now seems likely to gradually overcome this repulsion; and when
Constantinople and Bagdad shall be linked together by the steel bands,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</span>
the desert will lose its terrors, and Mesopotamia and Babylonia will
again become garden lands, as of old, under the abundant waters of the
Euphrates and Tigris. Until the water-supplies of the arid countries
shall have been more definitely gauged, it is impossible to foretell
to what extent food-production may be increased by their cultivation
under irrigation, after the relief from political misrule shall have
rendered such undertakings safe. But it can even now be foreseen that
with improved modern methods of cultivation, the productive area of
the world can be vastly increased by the utilization of the countries
where, as the Turcomans say, “the salt is the life of the land.”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle">ALKALI SOILS.</span></h3>
</div>

<p><i>Alkali Lands and Seashore Lands.</i>—Alkali lands proper, as
already stated, are wholly distinct in their nature and origin from the
salty lands of sea-coast marshes, past or present. The latter derive
their salts from sea-water that occasionally overflows them, or from
that which has evaporated in segregated basins or estuaries; and the
salts impregnating them are essentially “sea salts,” that is, common
salt, together with bittern (magnesium chlorid), Epsom salt (magnesium
sulfate) gypsum, etc. (<a href="#Page_26">see chapter 2, p. 26</a>).
Very little of what would be useful to vegetation or desirable as a
fertilizer is contained in the salts impregnating such soils; and they
are by no means always intrinsically rich in plant-food, but vary
greatly in this respect.</p>

<p>While seashore lands are by no means always of high fertility even
when freed from their salts, especially when very sandy, it is
otherwise when they occur near the mouths of streams or rivers, whose
finest sediments they then receive. From such lands are formed the
profusely productive Polders of Holland and northern Germany, and
the equally noted “colmates” of France and Italy. These, so soon as
freed from salt, may be considered as possessing the same advantages
as “delta” alluvial lands, and from the same causes; notably the accumulation
of the finest sediments derived from the rivers’ drainage basins.</p>

<p><i>Origin.</i>—Alkali lands proper bear no definite relation to the
present sea; they are mostly remote from it or from any other sea
bed, so that they have sometimes been designated as “terrestrial
salt lands.” Their existence is in the majority of cases definitely
traceable to climatic conditions alone. They are the natural result of
a light rainfall, insufficient to leach out of the land the salts that
always form in it by progressive weathering of the rock powder of which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</span>
all soils largely consist. Where the rainfall is abundant, that portion
of the salts corresponding to “sea salts” is leached out into the
bottom water, and with this passes through springs and rivulets into
the country drainage, to be finally carried to the ocean.<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>
Another portion of the salts formed by weathering, however, is partially or
wholly retained by the soil; it is that portion chiefly useful as plant food.</p>

<p>It follows that when, in consequence of insufficient rainfall, all or
most of the salts are retained in the soil, they will contain not only
the ingredients of sea-water, but also those useful to plants. In rainy
climates a large portion even of the latter is leached out and carried
away. In extremely arid climates, on the contrary, the entire mass of
the salts remains in the soils; and, being largely soluble in water,
evaporation during the dry season brings them to the surface, where
they may accumulate to such an extent as to render ordinary useful
vegetation impossible; as is seen in “alkali spots,” and sometimes in
extensive tracts of “alkali desert.” Three compounds, viz. the sulfate,
chlorid and carbonate of sodium, usually form the main mass of these
saline efflorescences. Magnesium sulfate (Epsom salt) is in many cases
a very abundant ingredient; some calcium sulfate is nearly always
present, and calcium chlorid is not infrequently found.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">In some cases the above salts are in part
at least derived from the leaching of adjacent or subjacent geological
deposits impregnated with them at the time of their formation. Such
is the case in portions of Wyoming, Colorado and New Mexico, in the
Colorado river delta, and in the Hungarian Plain; and it is in these
cases especially that the chlorids of calcium and magnesium also form
part of the saline mixture.</p>

<p><i>Geographical Distribution of Alkali Lands.</i>—In looking over a
rainfall map of the globe<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>
we see that a very considerable portion of the earth’s surface, forming
two belts to poleward of the two tropics, has deficient rainfall; the
latter term being commonly meant to imply any annual average less than
20 inches (500 millimeters). The arid region thus defined includes,
in North America, most of the country lying west of the one hundredth
meridian up to the Cascade Mountains,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</span>
and northward beyond the line of the United States; southward, it
reaches far into Mexico, including especially the Mexican plateau. In
South America it includes most of the Pacific Slope (Peru and Chile)
south to Araucania; and eastward of the Andes, the greater portion of
the plains of western Brazil and Argentina. In Europe only a small
portion of the Mediterranean border is included; but the entire African
coast-belt opposite, with the Saharan and Libyan deserts, Egypt and
Arabia, are included therein, as well as, south of the Equator, a
considerable portion of South Africa (Kalahari desert). In Asia, Asia
Minor, Syria (with Palestine), Mesopotamia, Persia, and northwestern
India up to the Ganges, and northward, the great plains or steppes of
central Asia eastward to Mongolia and western China, fall into the same
category; as does also a large portion of the Australian continent.</p>

<p><i>Utilization of World-wide Importance.</i>—Over these vast areas
alkali lands occur to a greater or less extent, the exceptions being
the mountain regions and adjacent lands on the side exposed to the
prevailing winds. It will therefore be seen that the problem of the
utilization of alkali lands for agriculture is not of local interest
only, but is of world-wide importance. It will also be noted that
many of the countries referred to are those in which the most ancient
civilizations have existed in the past, but which at present, with few
exceptions, are occupied by semi-civilized people only. It is doubtless
from this cause that the nature of alkali lands has until lately been
so little understood, that even their essential distinctness from the
sea-border lands has been but recently recognized in full. Moreover,
the great intrinsic fertility of these lands when freed from the
noxious salts, has been very little appreciated; their repellent aspect
causing them to be generally considered as permanently waste lands.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90"><i>Repellent aspect.</i>—This aspect is
essentially due to their natural vegetation being in most cases
confined to plants useless to man, commonly designated as “saline
vegetation,”<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>
of which but little is usually relished by cattle. Notable exceptions
to this rule occur in North and South America, Australia, and Africa,
where the “saltbushes” of the former and the “karroo” vegetation of the
latter form valuable pasture and browsing grounds. Apart from these,
however, all efforts to find culture plants for these lands generally
acceptable, or at least profitable, in their natural condition, have
not been very successful.

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</span></p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90"><a href="#FIG_60">Figure 60</a> illustrates the usual
aspect of alkali lands in the San Joaquin valley of California. It will be
noted that the alkali-covered surface is only in spots, with clumps of
vegetation between, so that cattle can find both pasture and browsing
on a portion of such lands, even though the plants so growing are
not usually of the most desirable kind. We find in all arid regions,
however, considerable areas either wholly destitute of vegetation, or
bearing only such saline growth as is rejected by all kinds of domestic animals.</p>

<p><i>Effects of Alkali upon culture plants.</i>—In land very strongly
impregnated with alkali salts, most culture plants, if their seed
germinates at all, will show a sickly growth for a short time, “spindle
up” and then die without fruiting. In soils less heavily charged the
plants may simply become dwarfed, and fruit scantily. The effect on
grown trees around which alkali has come up, is first, scanty leafage
and short growth of shoots, themselves but sparsely clothed with
leaves. This state of things is well shown in figures 61 and 62, which
represent apricot trees growing but a short distance apart, but one
coming within range of an expanding alkali spot. The characteristic
sparseness of the foliage of the “alkalied” tree as compared with the
adjacent one is well shown.</p>

<p><i>Nature of the injury to plants from Alkali.</i>—When we examine
plants that have been injured by alkali, we will mostly find that the
visible damage has been done near the base of the trunk, or <i>root
crown</i>; rarely at any considerable depth in the soil itself. In the
case of green herbaceous stems, the bark is found to have been turned
to a brownish tinge for half an inch or more, so as to be soft and
easily peeled off. In the case of trees, the rough bark is found to
be of a dark, almost black, tint, and the green layer underneath has,
as in the case of herbaceous stems, been turned brown to a greater or
less extent. In either case the plant has been practically “girdled,”
the effect being aggravated by the diseased sap poisoning more or less
the whole stem and roots. The plant may not die, but it will be quite
certain to become unprofitable to the grower.

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</span>
It is mainly in the case of land very heavily charged with common salt,
as in the marshes bordering the sea, or salt lakes, that injury arises
from the direct effects of the salty soil-water upon the feeding roots
themselves. In a few cases the gradual rise of salt water from below
in consequence of defective drainage, has seriously injured, and even
destroyed, old orange orchards. The natural occupancy of the ground
by certain native plants may be held to indicate that the soil is too
heavily charged with saline ingredients to permit healthy root growth
or nutrition until the excess of salts is removed. (See below, chapters
23 and 26).</p>

<p>The fact that in cultivated land the injury is usually found to
occur near the surface of the soil, concurrently with the well-known
fact that the maximum accumulation of salts at the surface is always
found near the end of the dry season, indicates clearly that this
accumulation is due to evaporation at the surface. The latter is
often found covered with a crust consisting of earth cemented by the
crystallized salts, and later in the season with a layer of whitish
dust resulting from the drying-out of the crust first formed. It is
this dust which becomes so annoying to the inhabitants and travelers
in alkali regions, when high winds prevail, irritating the eyes and
nostrils and parching the lips.</p>

<p><i>Effects of Irrigation.</i>—One of the most annoying and
discouraging features of the cultivation of lands in alkali regions
is that, although in their natural condition they may show but little
alkali on their surface, and that mostly in limited spots, these spots
are found to enlarge rapidly as irrigation is practiced. Yet since
alkali salts are the symptoms and result of insufficient rainfall,
irrigation is a necessary condition of agriculture wherever they
prevail. Under irrigation, neighboring spots will oftentimes merge
together into one large one, and at times the entire area, once highly
productive and perhaps covered with valuable plantations of trees or
vines, will become incapable of supporting useful growth. This annoying
phenomenon is popularly known as “the rise of the alkali” in the
western United States, but is equally well known in India and other
irrigation regions.</p>

<p>The soil being impregnated with a solution of the alkali salts, and
acting like a wick, the salts naturally remain behind on the surface as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</span>
the water evaporates, the process only stopping when the moisture in
the soil is exhausted. We thus not infrequently find that after an
unusually heavy rainfall there follows a heavier accumulation of alkali
salts at the surface, while a light shower produces no perceptible
permanent effect. We are thus taught that, within certain limits, the
more water evaporates during the season the heavier will be the rise of
the alkali; provided that the water is not so abundant as to leach the
salts through the soil and subsoil into the subdrainage.</p>

<p><i>Leaky Irrigation ditches.</i>—Worst of all, however, is the effect
of irrigation ditches laid in sandy lands (such as are naturally
predominant in arid regions), without proper provision against seepage.
The ditch water then gradually fills up the entire substrata so far
as they are permeable, and the water-table rises from below until it
reaches nearly to the ditch level; shallowing the subsoil, drowning out
the deep roots of all vegetation, and bringing close to the surface the
entire mass of alkali salts previously diffused through many feet of
substrata.</p>

<p><i>Surface and Substrata of Alkali Lands.</i>—Aside from the desert
proper, in the greater portion of the alkali country “alkali spots.”
<i>i. e.</i> ground covered with saline efflorescences and showing
little or no vegetation, are interspersed with larger areas apparently
free from salts and covered with the ordinary vegetation of the region.
A view of such country is given in a plate on a previous page. The
alkali spots are usually somewhat depressed below the surrounding
lands, and after rains remain covered with water for some time; the
water frequently assuming a brown or blackish tint after standing.</p>

<p>When a pointed steel probe is pushed down within such an alkali spot,
it will usually be found that, although the soil may appear quite
sandy, it is penetrated with some difficulty; while outside of the
spots, the probe does not encounter serious resistance until it reaches
the depth of two or three feet, when it frequently becomes impossible
to penetrate farther without the aid of a hammer. On the margin of the
spots, the transition from utter barrenness to a luxuriant vegetation
of native weeds is mostly quite sudden; as is shown in the
<a href="#FIG_60">figure, p. 425.</a></p>

<p><i>Vertical Distribution of the Salts in Alkali Land.</i>—The results
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</span>
of a comparative examination of such land before and after
irrigation,<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>
are shown in the annexed diagrams; in which the kind and amount of
salts is shown for every three inches of vertical depth, down to four
feet, by curves whose extension from left to right indicate the several
percentages, while the outer curved line gives the total of salts for
each of the several depths.</p>

<div class="blockquot fs_90">
<p><a href="#FIG_63">Fig. 63</a> represents the condition of the salts in an
“alkali spot” as found at the end of the dry season at the Tulare substation,
California. The soil was sampled to the depth of two feet at intervals
of three inches each. It is easy to see that at this time the bulk of
the salts was accumulated within the first six inches from the surface,
while lower down the soil contained so little that few culture plants
would be hurt by them.</p>

<p><i>How Native Plants Live.</i>—<a href="#FIG_64">Fig. 64</a> represents similarly
the state of things in a natural soil alongside of the alkali spot, but
in which the native vegetation of brilliant flowers develops annually
without any hindrance from alkali. Samples were taken from this spot
in March, near the end of the wet, and in September, near the end of
the dry season, and each series fully analyzed. There was scarcely a
noticeable difference in the results obtained. It is seen in the figure
that down to the depth of 15 inches there was practically no alkali
found (0.035%), and it was within these 15 inches of soil that the
native plants mostly had their roots and developed their annual growth.
But from that level downward the alkali rapidly increased, and reached
a maximum (0.529%), at about 33 inches; decreasing rapidly thence
until, at the end of the fourth foot in depth, there was not more
alkali than within the first foot from the surface. In other words,
the bulk of the salts had accumulated at the greatest depth to which
the annual rainfall (7 inches) ever reaches, forming there a sheet
of tough, intractable clay-hardpan. The shallow-rooted native plants
germinated their seeds freely on the alkali-free surface; their roots
kept above the strongly-charged subsoil, and through them and the stems
and foliage all the soil moisture was evaporated by the time the plants
died. Thus no alkali was brought up from below by evaporation. The seeds
shed would remain uninjured, and would again germinate the coming season.

It is thus that the luxuriant vegetation of the San Joaquin plains,
dotted with occasional alkali spots, is maintained; the spots
themselves being almost always depressions in which the rain water may
gather, and where, in consequence of the increased evaporation, the
noxious salts have risen to the surface and render impossible all but
the most resistant saline growth; particularly when, in consequence of
maceration and fermentation in the soil, the formation of carbonate of
soda has caused the surface to sink and become almost water-tight.</p>

<p><i>Upward Translocation from Irrigation.</i>—<a href="#FIG_65">Fig. 65</a> shows
the corresponding profile of the same soil after several years’ irrigation.
The upward movement of the salts is clearly seen by comparison with the
<a href="#FIG_64">previous figure</a>; and the surface soil has become so
charged with salts that the seeds of culture plants refuse to germinate.</p>

<p>Ten feet from this bare alkali ground, on which barley had refused to
grow, a crop of barley four feet high was harvested the same year,
without irrigation. Investigation proved that here the condition of
the soil was intermediate between the two preceding diagrams. The
irrigation water had dissolved the alkali of the subsoil, and the more
abundant evaporation had brought it nearer the surface; but the shading
by the barley crop and the evaporation of the moisture through its
roots and leaves had prevented the salts from reaching the surface in
such amounts as to injure the crop, although the tendency to rise was
clearly shown. By the use of gypsum, moreover, the injuriousness of the
alkali had been somewhat diminished.</p>

<p>The same season, grain crops were almost a failure on alkali-free
land in the same region; and in connection with this result it should
be noted as a general fact that alkali lands always retain a certain
amount of moisture perceptible to the hand during the dry season, and
that <i>this moisture can be utilized by crops</i>; so that at times
when crops fail on non-alkaline land, good ones are obtained where a
slight taint of alkali exists in the soil. Actual determinations showed
that while a sample of alkali soil containing .54% of salts absorbed
12.3% of moisture from moist air, the same soil when leached absorbed
only 2.5%—a figure corresponding to that of sandy upland loams.

              of Alkali Salts in Sandy Lands.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Alkali in Sandy Lands.</i>—In <i>very</i> sandy lands, and
particularly when the alkali is “white” only, the tendency to
accumulation near the surface is much less, even under irrigation. In
the natural condition the salts are in such cases often found quite
evenly distributed through soil columns of four feet, and even more.
This is an additional cause of the lesser injuriousness of “white
alkali.” An illustration of the distribution of the salts in very sandy
lands, from the Tulare substation, is given in <a href="#FIG_66">Fig. 66</a>. Here
we see that the maximum is not <i>at</i>, but some distance below the surface,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</span>
the entire saline mass is lower down than in the more clayey loam of
the same locality, and is more widely distributed in depth.</p>

<p><i>Distribution of Alkali Salts in Heavy Lands.</i>—The mode of
distribution of alkali salts in the heavier, close-grained soil of the
Chino experimental tract in southern California, is illustrated in
<a href="#FIG_67">Fig. 67</a>. This land is permanently moist, from a water-table
ranging from five to seven feet below the surface in ordinary years. There
is therefore no opportunity for the formation of “alkali hardpan” as
in the case of the Tulare soil; the salts always remain rather near
the surface, viz. within twelve to fifteen inches. But being in much
smaller average amounts than at Tulare (an average of about 5300 lbs.
per acre), quite a copious natural vegetation of grasses, sunflowers,
and “yerba mansa” covered the whole surface, save in a few low spots.</p>

<p>A similar mode of distribution of the salts is found in the still more
clayey “black adobe” lands of the Great Valley of California. The
scanty rains cannot penetrate these soils to any great depth, so that
evaporation will soon bring the salts carried by them back to within a
short distance of the surface. Their accumulation there is frequently
indicated by the entire absence of any but the most resistant alkali
weeds, even though the total of salts in the land may not be very great.</p>

<p><i>Salton Basin.</i>—A peculiar state of things is illustrated in the
Salton Basin, which represents what was at one time the head of the
Gulf of California, and at the lowest point of which, 268 feet below
sea level, there now lies a large deposit of rock salt. It has been cut
off from the present Gulf by the delta deposits of the Colorado river,
which now, however, overflows into the Basin at times of extreme high
water. Although appearing level to the eye, the general slope of the
country is to the lowest point of the former sea-bottom.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">The region, now in progress of settlement
by means of irrigation water brought from the river near Yuma, was
investigated with respect to its alkali conditions in 1900 (Bulletin
No. 140, Calif. Agric. Expt. Sta.). The annexed diagram 68 shows the
distribution of the salts to a depth of 21 feet. It will be noted that
here also the alkali content becomes insignificant at 4 feet depth, but
increases again to a second maximum at about 15 feet, below which there
is a second decrease; below this, at 20 feet, there is a final very
heavy increase, not only of the total salts but especially of common
salt, which evidently represents the drainage toward the salt deposit.
Above this level there is a very remarkable predominance of Glauber’s
salt (sodium sulfate), also observable elsewhere, <i>e. g.</i> near
White Plains, Nev., whose name is derived from the copious surface
accumulation of the sulfate. It seems as though this must have been
formed in some way from the common salt.

<i>Horizontal Distribution of Alkali Salts in Arid Lands.</i>—The
constant occurrence of “alkali spots” in arid lands shows at once the
great inequality of horizontal distribution of alkali impregnation.
This is as prominent in level lands as on slopes, and in extremely arid
regions it is mostly not possible to recognize even very considerable
differences without close examination. Thus in lands appearing exactly
alike on the surface, on the edge of the Salton basin in California,
on the same forty acre 1.4% (56,000 pounds per acre) was found in
the surface four feet at one point, and a hundred yards away, 12.5%
(500,000 pounds). The mapping of alkali lands is therefore somewhat
precarious unless carried into great detail. Moreover, it has been
found that the location of the salts changes from year to year,
especially in irrigated land, as might be expected. Those cultivating
alkali lands have therefore to exercise constant watchfulness, unless
the salts have been definitively eliminated by underdrainage over
a considerable area; as merely local operations may be rendered
ineffectual by the migration of the salts from neighboring tracts not
reclaimed.</p>

<p><i>Alkali in Hill Lands.</i>—As a rule, hill lands themselves are
remarkably free from alkali, even in the arid regions; except when
water is gathered in depressions, where strongly saline waters may
be found in Washington, Montana and elsewhere. But on level plateau
lands, where drainage is slow or imperfect, alkali appears as freely as
it does in the same regions in the stream bottoms. In the latter the
leachings and seepage of the uplands naturally causes a concentration
of the salts, and thus we find alkali salts incrusting the surface in
the valleys of the streams, as <i>e. g.</i>, that of the Yellowstone,
Musselshell, Judith, Yakima and others in the north, and of Green
river, Platte, Pecos, and Rio Grande farther south; as well as in
numerous valleys of central and southern California.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</span></p>

<p><i>Usar Lands of India.</i>—These lands have been investigated
first by the “Reh Commission” appointed to investigate the causes of
the deterioration of lands in the Aligarh district (south of Delhi,
between the Ganges and Jumna rivers), in 1876. The occasion of this
appointment was the appearance of “reh” (alkali salts) in a region
which had previously been free from them.<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>
Subsequently, a more elaborate investigation of the subject was made by
Dr. J. W. Leather, Agricultural Chemist to the Government of India.<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>
From these documents it appears that “usar lands” exist largely not
only in the Northwestern Provinces and Oudh, but also in the Panjab,
especially on the lands bordering the Chenab river; likewise to a
slight extent in the Bombay presidency. Leather’s investigation shows
that not all the lands designated by the natives as <i>usar</i>
contain soluble salts in injurious amounts, some being simply lands
having very hard, clayey soils difficult to till with the imperfect
methods employed. Yet the general phenomena of the true “reh” lands
are practically identical with those of the American alkali lands,
including also the calcareous hardpan, there called <i>kankar</i>.
Owing probably to the long cultivation of the Indian lands (mostly
under irrigation), the salts are there at their maximum in the first
foot, decreasing as depth increases. It is noteworthy also that in the
majority of cases the predominant salt is carbonate of soda or black
alkali, which there as in California renders the lands impervious to
water until treated with gypsum. This fact accounts for the popular use
of the same name for non-saline impervious clay soils, and the alkali
or reh lands proper.</p>

<p>We have an entirely analogous case in the “Szek” lands of the Hungarian
plain, some of which are simply poor refractory soils containing a
trace of soluble salts; while lower down in the valley of the Theiss
we find genuine alkali lands, both black and white, which have long
furnished carbonate of soda for local use and commerce. In this case,
however, the alkali salts seen to come largely, in some cases wholly,
from underlying saline clays whose salts in coming to the surface
suffer precisely the same transformations experienced in California and
India, in presence of calcic carbonate (<a href="#Page_450">see below, p. 450 ff</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</span>
The accounts given by v. Middendorff of the nature and occurrence of
alkali lands in Turkestan (Ferghana) agree entirely with those given
above for California and India; as do also the investigations made by
other Russian observers on the saline lands of the steppes of European
Russia.</p>

<h4>COMPOSITION AND QUANTITY<br> OF ALKALI SALTS.</h4>

<p><i>Black and White Alkali.</i>—Broadly speaking, the world over alkali
salts consist mainly of three chief ingredients, already mentioned,
namely, common salt, Glauber’s salt (sulfate of soda), and salsoda or
carbonate<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>
of soda. The latter causes what is popularly known as “black alkali,”
from the black spots of puddles seen on the surface of lands tainted
with it, owing to the dissolution of the soil humus;<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>
while the other salts, often together with Epsom salt and bittern
(Magnesium chlorid), constitute “white alkali,” which is known to
be very much milder in its effect on plants than the black. In most
cases all three are present, and all may be considered as practically
valueless, or noxious, to plant growth.

<i>Nutritive Salts in Alkali.</i>—With them, however, there are almost
always associated, in varying amounts, sulfate of potash, phosphate of
soda, and nitrate of soda, representing the three elements—potassium,
phosphorus, and nitrogen—upon the presence of which in the soil in
available form, the welfare of our crops so essentially depends, and
which we aim to supply in fertilizers. The potash salt is usually
present to the extent of from 5 to 20 per cent of the total salts;
phosphate, from a fraction of one to as much as 4 percent; the nitrate
from a fraction of one to as much as 20 percent. In black alkali the
nitrate is usually low, the phosphate high; in the white, the reverse
is true. Both relations are readily intelligible from a chemical and
bacteriological point of view.</p>

<p><i>Estimation of Total Alkali in Land.</i>—The investigations detailed
above having shown that in California at least, outside of the axes
of valleys no practically important amount of alkali salts is usually
found at a depth exceeding four feet, it became possible to determine
approximately the amounts of salts that would have to be dealt with
when irrigation and evaporation should bring the entire amount to or
near the surface; a necessary prerequisite to the determination of
possible cultures. While, as already shown, the salts occur lower down
in very sandy lands, yet the diagram on p. 435 shows that even then, an
estimate on this basis would not be very wide of the truth. It is at
least probable that the same is measurably true of level alkali lands
elsewhere, when not underlaid by geological deposits impregnated with salts.</p>

<p>The total amount of these salts ordinarily found in alkali lands (<i>i.
e.</i> in such as in the dry season show saline efflorescences on the
surface) is from about one tenth of one per cent to as much as three
per cent of the weight of the soil, taken to the depth of four feet.
The percentage of salts having been determined in samples representing
a tract, it becomes easy to calculate, approximately, the total amounts
of each salt present per acre, on the basis of the weight of the soil
per acre foot. For the soils of the arid region, such weight will
usually range from three million five hundred thousand to four million
pounds per acre-foot; the latter being the most usual figure, of which
it may be conveniently remembered, that forty thousand pounds represent
1 per cent. We are thus enabled to estimate <i>e. g.</i> the amount of
gypsum required to neutralize the carbonate of soda in the salts, or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</span>
the amounts of valuable nutritive ingredients—potash, phosphoric acid
and nitrates—present in the land in the water-soluble form.</p>

<p>As has been shown in the preceding discussion, the analysis at the
surface foot alone, which has frequently been alone made, gives no
definite clew whatever to the <i>total</i> amounts of salts to be
controlled. A <i>full</i> estimate is of special importance in enabling
us to forecast what culture plants are likely to succeed on a given
tract, by reference to the table of “tolerances” given below
(<a href="#Page_467">chapter 23, page 467</a>).</p>

<p><i>Composition of Alkali Soils as a Whole.</i>—As may be imagined,
the presence of the alkali salts finds expression in the analytical
statement of their composition, although not to the extent usually
anticipated from their superficial aspect. The table annexed gives
the composition of fourteen alkali soils, taken to the depth of one
foot, at times when there was no visible accumulation of salts on the
surface. The averages of the several ingredients determined are given
in the fifteenth column, and a comparison of its figures with those
of the general table on <a href="#Page_377">page 377 of chapter 20</a>
will show some marked characteristics. We find the average
potash-content to be but little less than twice as great as in the
general average for the state of California; in the case of lime the
ratio is nearly as one to three, in the case of magnesia nearly one to
two; in that of phosphoric acid, one to two and a half, of which in the
presence of carbonate of soda an unusually large proportion is in a
readily soluble, often in the water-soluble, condition (see preceding
table).</p>

<p>The usual proportion of soda, of one-fourth to one-half of the
amount of potash, is changed to one-half or three-fourths; in the
case of the strongest alkali lands soda may equal or even exceed the
potash content. As the latter, however, is invariably high to very
high, it does not happen as frequently as might be supposed that the
soda content exceeds that of potash as shown by the usual method of
soil-extraction with water.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">That the <i>potash</i> percentage should
always be high in alkali lands, is hardly surprising when it is
considered that the continued presence of the salts resulting from
rock decomposition affords opportunity for the full exercise of
the preference with which potash is known to be retained in soils
by the formation of complex zeolitic silicates. In most cases the
potash-percentage exceeds .75%, and rises as high as 2.0%; as is shown
in the table.

This table exhibits also another standing characteristic of alkali
soils, which is to be anticipated from the conditions of their
formation; viz, high <i>lime-content</i>, which sometimes rises to the
extent of marliness.</p>

<p>In <i>phosphates</i>, also, alkali soils are almost always high; and an
unusually large proportion is found to be readily soluble.</p>

<p>In presence of much carbonate of soda, <i>nitrates</i> are usually
scarce or altogether absent; while owing to the action of the alkaline
solution upon the humus, ammonia salts, or even free (or carbonated
and therefore readily dissociated and assimilated) <i>ammonia</i> may
be present, so as to be perceptible to the senses by its odor in hot
sunshine. But in the case of “white alkali,” more especially of the
sulphate in moderate amounts, nitrification is exceedingly active and
nitrates may sometimes rise to as much as 20% of the soluble salts. As
alkali spots are usually low in the central portion and therefore more
moist than around the edges, we sometimes find ammonia salts in the
middle of a spot, while nitrates are abundant along the margin of the
same. These differences, first demonstrated by an investigation made
by Colmore,<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>
illustrate some of the reactions that are essentially concerned in
the agricultural availability of alkali lands. A summary of Colmore’s
results is given in the table below.</p>

<p><i>Cross Section of an Alkali Spot.</i>—The spot examined lies outside
of Tulare, California, substation; it being late in the season, when

<p>While the table shows an obvious irregularity in some of the data
at the eight-foot point, arising doubtless from an irregularity of
surface or of texture overlooked in taking the samples, we find a very
remarkable regularity of progression in the cases of potassium sulfate,
sodium chlorid, sodium carbonate and sodium phosphate in the other
four samples. The maxima of the “black alkali” and the soluble organic
matter (humus) coincide, as does that of the phosphate; the total
mineral salts at the outer margin are only a little over half of what
is found at the center. This is natural, as owing to the deflocculating
effect of the black alkali, the center is nearly a foot lower than the
margin. The lowering of the nitrate-content at the outer margin is
obviously due to the luxuriant vegetation growing adjacent.</p>

<p><i>Reactions between the Carbonates, Chlorids and Sulfates of Alkalies
and Earths.</i> That a soluble earth-salt, such as the sulfate or
chlorid of calcium, will react upon an alkaline carbonate solution so
as to form an alkali sulfate, and <i>e.g.</i> lime carbonate, is well
known; the neutralization of the sodic carbonate in the soil by means
of gypsum, above referred to, is based upon this reaction. It is not
so well known that the latter may be reversed, partly or wholly, by
the presence of carbonic acid in the solution of the soil. Although
observed as early as 1824 by Brandes, and again in 1859 by A. Müller,
this reaction is not mentioned in text-books and attracted no attention
as a source of naturally occurring alkali carbonates which in the past
have formed the basis of extensive commerce from the Orient, until in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</span>
1888, the writer together with Weber and later with Jaffa, investigated
it quantitatively.<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>
It was found that up to .75 grms. per liter, the entire amount of sodic
sulfate present in solution is transformed into carbonate in presence
of calcic carbonate, by a current of carbonic dioxid; but the amount
so transformed does not continue to increase beyond about 4 grams per
liter. A corresponding amount of calcic sulfate is formed. In the case
of potassic sulfate, the transformation also occurs, proportionally to
the molecular weight. This relation is shown in the subjoined diagram,
which also shows in the curves on the left, the residual alkalinity
left after evaporation and drying the residue at 100° C.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img id="FIG_69" src="images/image450.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="393" >
    <p class="blockquot fs_90"><span class="smcap">Fig. 69.</span>—Progressive
       Transformation of Alkali Sulfates into Carbonates.<br>(The figures along
       upper line represent tenths of one per cent.)</p>
</div>

<p>The corresponding reaction occurs also, of course, between sodium
chlorid and calcium carbonate, but not to the same extent, because
unlike the difficultly soluble gypsum, the reaction product is the very
soluble calcium chlorid, the presence of which in the solution limits
the reaction much sooner than when most of the decomposition product is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</span>
thrown down in the solid state. The calcium chlorid not uncommonly
found in some alkali regions is undoubtedly the product of the above
reaction.</p>

<p>As the saline solutions in the soil are mostly quite dilute, and
calcic carbonate is always present, it follows that whenever under the
influences which favor the oxidation of organic matter in the soil,
and the activity of the plant roots, carbonic gas is formed somewhat
copiously, alkali sulfates and chlorids present may be partially or
wholly transformed into carbonates within the soil. As a matter of
fact, it is found that this transformation occurs most readily in the
moister portions of the soil and subsoil, and <i>invariably so when
an alkali soil is “swamped” by excessive irrigation or rise of bottom
water</i>; while the reaction is again reversed whenever free access of
air reduces the carbonic dioxid below a certain point. It thus becomes
intelligible why in the diagrams showing the distribution of the salts
(this chapter pp. <a href="#Page_431">431 and 432</a>), we always find the
sodic carbonate relatively <i>decreasing</i> as the surface is approached.</p>

<p>Thus, also, is explained the fact that sodium carbonate is formed more
abundantly toward the center of the root system of alkali plants, such
as the greasewood, beneath which the soil is always more abundantly
charged with “black alkali” than is the surrounding earth.</p>

<p>Good aeration of the soil mass, then, is essential in maintaining the
neutralization of the “black alkali” soils brought about by the use of
gypsum (land plaster).</p>

<p><i>Inverse Ratios of Alkali Carbonates and Sulfates.</i>—According
to the above considerations, it is not surprising that we should
often find an apparent inverse ratio between the alkali sulfates and
carbonates in soils so closely adjacent that their salts must be
presumed to be similar in composition. A striking example is shown in
<a href="#FIG_70">fig. 70</a>, in which this inverse ratio becomes apparent four
times in succession in one and the same soil profile. While this inference is
plain on the face of the diagram, it is not quite easy to explain in
detail how this alternation came about from the condition observed
two months previously. Most probably it was caused by corresponding
alternations of weather, in which short, warm spring showers alternated
with similarly brief periods of drying north winds; the latter causing
a reversal of the formation of sodic carbonate that had been induced by
the former.

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</span>
<i>Exceptional Conditions.</i>—While the phenomena of alkali lands as
outlined above probably represent the vastly predominant conditions
on level lands, yet there are exceptions due to surface conformation,
and the local existence of sources of alkali salts outside of the soil
itself. Such is the case where salts ooze out of strata cropping out on
hillsides, as at some points in the San Joaquin Valley in California,
and in parts of New Mexico, Colorado and Wyoming; also where, as in
the Hungarian plain, saline clays underlie within reach of surface
evaporation.</p>

<p>Again, it not infrequently happens that in sloping valleys or basins,
where the central (lowest) portion receives the salts leached out of
the soils of the adjacent slopes, we find belts of greater or less
width in which the alkali impregnation may reach to the depth of
ten or twelve feet, usually within more or less definite layers of
calcareous hardpan, likewise the outcome of the leaching of the valley
slopes. Such areas, however, are usually quite limited, and are at
present scarcely reclaimable without excessive expenditure; the more
as they are often underlaid by saline bottom water. In these cases
the predominant saline ingredient is usually common salt, as might be
expected and as is exemplified in the Great Salt Lake of Utah, in the
Antelope and Perris Valleys, and in Salton basin in California; in the
Yellowstone valley near Billings, Mont.<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>
in the Aralo-Caspian desert, and at many other points.</p>

<p><i>Conclusions.</i>—Summing up the conclusions from the foregoing
facts and considerations, we find that—</p>

<p>(1) The amount of soluble salts in alkali lands is usually limited;
they are not ordinarily supplied in indefinite quantities from the
bottom-water below. These salts have mostly been formed by weathering
in the soil-layer itself.</p>

<p>(2) The salts move up and down within the upper four or five feet
of the soil and subsoil, following the movement of the moisture;
descending in the rainy season to the limit of the annual moistening
as a maximum, and then reascending or not, according as surface
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</span>
evaporation may demand. At the end of the dry season, in untilled
irrigated land, practically the entire mass of salts may be within six
or eight inches of the surface.</p>

<p>(3) The direct injury to vegetation<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>
is caused largely within a few inches of the surface, by the corrosion
of the bark, usually near the root crown. This corrosion is strongest
when carbonate of soda (salsoda) forms a large proportion of the salts;
the soda then also dissolves the vegetable mold and causes blackish
spots in the soil, popularly known as black alkali.</p>

<p>(4) The injury caused by carbonate of soda is aggravated by its action
in puddling the soil so as to cause it to lose its crumbly or flaky
condition, rendering it almost or quite untillable and impervious. It
also tends to form in the depths of the soil-layer a tough, impervious
hardpan, which yields neither to plow, pick, nor crowbar. Its presence
is easily ascertained by means of a pointed steel sounding-rod.</p>

<p>(5) While alkali lands share with other soils of the arid region the
advantage of unusually high percentages of plant-food in the insoluble
form, they also contain, alongside of the noxious salts, considerable
amounts of water-soluble plant-food. When, therefore, the action of the
noxious salts is done away with, they should be profusely and lastingly
productive; particularly as they are always naturally somewhat moist
in consequence of the attraction of moisture by the salts, and are
therefore less liable to injury from drought than the same soils when
free from alkali.</p>

<p><i>Alkali-Resistant Crops.</i>—The most obvious mode of utilizing
alkali lands is to occupy them with crops not affected by the noxious
salts. Unfortunately but few such crops of general utility have as yet
been found for the stronger class of alkali lands. The question is
always one of degree, which frequently cannot be decided without an
actual determination of the amount and kind of salts to be dealt with,
to which the crops can then be adapted in accordance with the greater
or less sensitiveness of the several plants, as indicated in the
table of tolerances given farther on. But aside from this, there are
certain general measures and precautions which in any case will serve
to mitigate the effect of the alkali salts. Foremost among these, and
applicable everywhere, is the prevention of evaporation to the utmost
extent possible.</p>

<p><i>Counteracting Evaporation.</i>—Since evaporation of the
soil-moisture at the surface is what brings the alkali to the level
where the main injury to plants occurs, it is obvious that evaporation
should be prevented as much as possible. This is the more important,
as the saving of soil-moisture, and therefore of irrigation water, is
attainable by the same means.</p>

<p>Three methods for this purpose are usually practiced, viz., shading,
mulching, and the maintenance of loose tilth in the surface soil to
such depth as may be required by the climatic conditions.</p>

<p>As to mulching, it is already well recognized in the alkali regions
of California as an effective remedy in light cases. Fruit trees are
frequently thus protected, particularly while young, after which their
shade alone may (as in the case of low-trained orange trees) suffice
to prevent injury. The same often happens in the case of low-trained
vines, small-fruit, and vegetables. Sanding of the surface to the depth
of several inches was among the first attempts in this direction; but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</span>
the necessity of cultivation, involving the renewal of the sand each
season, renders this a costly method. Straw, leaves, and manure
have been more successfully used; but even these, unless employed
for the purpose of fertilization, involve more expense and trouble
than the simple <i>maintenance of very loose tilth of the surface
soil throughout the dry season</i>; a remedy which, of course, is
equally applicable to hoed field crops, and is in the case of some of
these—<i>e. g.</i>, cotton—a necessary condition of cultural success
everywhere. The wide prevalence of “light” soils in the arid regions,
from causes inherent in the climate itself, renders this condition
relatively easy of fulfilment.</p>

<p><i>Turning-under of Surface Alkali.</i>—Aside, however, from the
mere prevention of surface evaporation, another favorable condition
is realized by this procedure, namely the commingling of the heavily
salt-charged surface-layers with the relatively non-alkaline subsoil.
Since in the arid regions the roots of all plants retire farther
from the surface because of the deadly drought and heat of summer,
it is usually possible to cultivate deeper than could safely be done
with growing crops in humid climates. Yet even there, the maxim of
“deep preparation and shallow cultivation” is put into practice with
advantage, only changing the measurements of depth to correspond with
the altered climatic conditions. Thus while in the humid States, three
to four inches is the accepted standard of depth for summer cultivation
to preserve moisture without injury to the roots, that depth must in
the arid region frequently be doubled in order to be effective; and
will even then scarcely touch a living root in orchards and vineyards,
particularly in unmanured and unirrigated land.</p>

<p>A glance at <a href="#FIG_63">fig. 63, (chap. 22, p. 431)</a>, will show the
great advantage of extra-deep preparation in commingling the alkali salts accumulated
near the surface with the lower soil-layers, diffusing the salts, say
through twelve instead of six inches of soil mass. This will in very
many cases suffice to render the growth of ordinary crops possible if,
by subsequent frequent and thorough cultivation, surface evaporation,
and with it the re-ascent of the salts to the surface, is prevented.</p>

<p>A striking example of the efficiency of this mode of procedure was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</span>
observed at the Tulare substation, California, where a portion of a
very bad alkali spot was trenched to the depth of two feet, throwing
the surface soil to the bottom. The spot thus treated produced
excellent wheat crops for two years—the time it took the alkali salts
to reascend to the surface.</p>

<p>It should therefore be kept in mind that whatever else is done toward
reclamation, <i>deep preparation and thorough cultivation</i> must be
regarded as prime factors for the maintenance of production on alkali lands.</p>

<p><i>The Efficacy of Shading</i>, already referred to, is strikingly
illustrated in the case of some field crops which, when once
established, will thrive on fairly strong alkali soil, provided that
a good thick “stand” has once been obtained. This is notably true
of the great forage crop of the arid region, alfalfa or lucern. Its
seed is extremely sensitive to “black” alkali, and will decay in the
ground unless protected against it by the use of gypsum in sowing. But
when once a full stand has been obtained, the field may endure for
many years without a sign of injury. Here two effects combine, viz.,
the shading, and the evaporation through the deep roots and abundant
foliage, which alone prevents, in a large measure, the ascent of the
moisture and salts to the surface. The case is then precisely parallel
to that of the natural soil (<a href="#Page_432">see p. 432, chapter 22</a>),
except that, as irrigation is practiced in order to stimulate
production, the sheet of alkali hardpan will be dissolved and its salts
spread through the soil more evenly. The result is that so soon as the
alfalfa is taken off the ground and the cultivation of other crops is
attempted, an altogether unexpectedly large amount of alkali comes to
the surface and greatly impedes, if it does not altogether prevent, the
immediate planting of other crops. Shallow-rooted annual crops that
give but little shade, like the cereals, while measurably impeding
the rise of the salts during their growth (<a href="#FIG_70">see fig. 70, page 452</a>)
frequently allow of enough rise after harvest to prevent reseeding the
following season.</p>

<p><i>“Neutralising” Black Alkali.</i>—Since so little carbonate of
soda as one-tenth of one per cent may suffice to render some soils
uncultivable, it frequently happens that its mere transformation into
the sulfate is sufficient to remove all stress from alkali. Gypsum
(land plaster) is the cheap and effective agent to bring about this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</span>
transformation, provided water be also present. The amount required
per acre will, of course, vary with the amount of salts in the soil,
all the way from a few hundred pounds to several tons in the case of
strong alkali spots; but it is not usually necessary to add the entire
quantity at once, provided that sufficient be used to neutralize the
sodic carbonate near the surface, and enough time be allowed for the
action to take place. In very wet soil, and when much gypsum is used,
this may occur within a few days; in merely damp soils in the course of
months; but usually the effect increases for years, as the salts rise
from below.</p>

<p>The effect of gypsum on black-alkali land is often very striking,
even to the eye. The blackish puddles and spots disappear, because
the gypsum renders the dissolved humus insoluble and thus restores it
to the soil. The latter soon loses its hard, puddled condition and
crumbles and bulges into a loose mass, into which water now soaks
freely, bringing up the previously depressed spots to the general level
of the land. On the surface thus changed, seeds now germinate and grow
without hindrance; and as the injury from alkali occurs at or near the
surface, it is usually best to simply harrow in the plaster, leaving
the water to carry it down in solution. Soluble phosphates present
are decomposed so as to retain finely divided, but less soluble earth
phosphates in the soil.</p>

<p>It must not be forgotten that this beneficial change may go backward
if the land thus treated is permitted to be swamped by irrigation
water or otherwise. Under the same conditions naturally white alkali
may turn black (<a href="#Page_451">see above, chapter 22, p. 451</a>).
Of course, gypsum is of no benefit whatever on soils containing no “black”
alkali, but only (“white”) Glauber’s and common salt.</p>

<p><i>Removing the Salts from the Soil.</i>—In case the amount of salts
in the soil should be so great that even the change worked by gypsum is
insufficient to render it available for useful crops, the only remedy
left is to remove the salts, partially or wholly, at least from the
<i>surface</i> of the land. Three chief methods are available for this
purpose. One is to remove the salts, with more or less earth, from the
surface at the end of the dry season, either by sweeping or by means of
a horse scraper set so as to carry off a certain depth of soil. Thus
sometimes in a single season one-third or one-half of the total salts
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</span>
may be got rid of, the loss of a few inches of surface soil being of
little moment in the deep soils of the arid region. Another method
affording partial relief is to flood the land for a sufficient length
of time to carry the alkali three or more feet below the surface, then
carefully preventing its re-ascent by suppressing evaporation (<a href="#Page_455">see this
chapter, p. 455</a>) as much as possible. The best of all, the final and
universally efficient remedy, is to leach the alkali salt out of the
soil into the country drainage; supplementing by irrigation water what
is left undone by the deficient rainfall.</p>

<p>It is not practicable, as many suppose, to wash the salts off the
surface by a rush of water, as they instantly soak into the ground at
the first touch. Nor is there any certain relief from allowing the
water to stand on the land and then drawing it off; in this case also
the salts soak down ahead of the water, and the water standing on the
surface remains almost unchanged. In very pervious soils and in the
case of white alkali, the washing-out can often be accomplished without
special provision for underdrainage, by leaving the water on the land
sufficiently long. But the laying of regular underdrains greatly
accelerates the work, and renders success certain.</p>

<p><i>Leaching-Down.</i>—In advance of underdrainage, it is quite
generally feasible, where the land has been leveled and diked for
irrigation by surface flooding, to leach the salts out of the first
three or four feet by continued flooding, thus taking them out of
reach of the crop roots, or at all events giving the <i>seed</i> an
opportunity to escape injury from alkali. This plan is especially
effective in the case of alfalfa, the young seedlings of which are
very sensitive, while the grown plant is rather resistant. In order
to obtain this relief so as to know what is being accomplished, the
farmer should ascertain beforehand how fast water will soak down in his
ground;<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>
for in heavy clay soils, and especially in those containing
black alkali, the soakage is sometimes so slow that the upward
diffusion of the salts keeps pace with the downward soakage; in which
case nothing is accomplished by flooding, and underdrainage is the only
remedy. But in most soils of the arid region flooding from three days
to a week will remove the alkali beyond reach of the roots of ordinary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</span>
crops. If subsequently irrigation is done by means of <i>deep</i>
furrows, the alkali salts may be either kept at a low level
continuously, or if the land be at all pervious, the alkali may
ultimately be permanently leached out into the subdrainage by farther
flooding. When the alkali has not accumulated near the surface to any
great extent, irrigation by deep furrows may, alone, afford all the
relief needed.</p>

    <p class="f90 spb2"><span class="smcap">Fig. 71.</span>—Lemon Orchard
            Affected by Alkali; Before Deep Irrigation.</p>
</div>

<p>In the case illustrated by figures 71 and 72, irrigation by shallow
furrows with water too strongly charged with salts had so far added to
the natural alkali-content of the land that the lemon trees were being
defoliated. Upon the advice of the California Station the deep-furrow
system was adopted, and within two years the results were as shown in
<a href="#FIG_72">figure 72</a>, the salts having been carried down
and diluted so as to become harmless.</p>

<p><i>Underdrainage the Final and Universal Remedy for Alkali.</i>—When
we underdrain an alkali soil, we adopt the very means by which the
existence of alkali lands in the humid regions is wholly prevented;
the leaching-out of the soluble salts formed in soil-weathering as
fast as they are formed. The long and abundant experience had with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</span>
underdrainage in reclaiming saline sea-coast lands, applies directly
and cogently to alkali lands. It is the universal remedy for all the
evils of alkali, and its only drawback is the first expense, and the
necessity for obtaining an outlet for the drain waters, which cannot
always be had on the owner’s land. Hence it requires co-operation or
legislation to render the great improvement of underdrainage feasible.
Such legislation is well established in the old world, and has been
enacted in several states even of the humid region. Where irrigation
is practiced as a matter of necessity, underdrainage is a correlative
necessity, both to avoid the evils of over-irrigation and to relieve
the land of noxious alkali salts.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

    <p class="f90 spb2"><span class="smcap">Fig. 72.</span>—The Above
         Orchard after Alkali was Driven Down<br> by Deep Irrigation,
         followed by Cultivation.</p>
</div>

<p>The drainage law now existing in California does not go farther
than to authorize the formation of drainage districts, within which
the necessary taxes may be levied; and there is some difficulty in
securing popular action. But bitter experience will doubtless in time
compel unanimity, such as now exists, <i>e. g.</i>, in Illinois, where
drainage is not nearly so urgently needed as it is in the irrigation states.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</span></p>

<p><i>Possible Injury to Land by Excessive Leaching.</i>—It should not
be forgotten, however, that excessive leaching of underdrained land
by flooding is liable to injure the soil in two ways: first, by the
removal of valuable soluble plant-food; and further, by rendering the
land less retentive of moisture, such retention being favored by the
presence of small amounts of alkali salts, not sufficient to injure
crops. After the salts have been carried down to a sufficient depth to
prevent injury to annual crops, and with proper subsequent attention
to the prevention of surface evaporation, the flooding will not need
to be repeated for several years. Thus in many soils excellent crops
may be grown even in strong alkali land, pending the establishment of
permanent drainage systems.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">The importance of thoroughly washing the
alkali deeply into the soil before the seed is planted, and keeping
it there by proper means until the foliage of the plant shades the
soil sufficiently to prevent the rise of moisture and alkali, is well
illustrated in fields in the region of Bakersfield, Cal., where alfalfa
is now growing in soils once heavily charged with alkali.<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>
From one of these fields samples of soil were taken where the alkali
was supposed to be strongest beneath the alfalfa, and also from an
adjoining untreated alkali spot, which was said to represent conditions
before alfalfa was planted. The results are given in pounds per acre in
four feet depth.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">Here the surface foot of the natural soil
contained nearly 140,000 pounds of common salt, a prohibitory amount.
Similar experience has been had near Yuma, Arizona.</p>

<p><i>Difficulty in Draining “Black” Alkali Lands.</i>—An important
exception to the efficacy of draining, however, occurs in the case of
black alkali in most lands. In this case either the impervious hardpan
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</span>
or (in the case of actual alkali spots) the impenetrability of the
surface soil itself will render even underdrains ineffective unless
the salsoda and its effects on the soil are first destroyed by the
use of gypsum, as above detailed. This is not only necessary in order
to render drainage and leaching possible, but is also advisable in
order to prevent the leaching-out of the valuable humus and soluble
phosphates, which are rendered insoluble (but not unavailable to
plants) by the action of the gypsum. Wherever black alkali is found
in lands not very sandy, the application of gypsum should precede any
other efforts toward reclamation. Trees and vines already planted may
be temporarily protected from the worst effects of the black alkali by
surrounding the trunks with gypsum or with earth abundantly mixed with
it. Seeds may be similarly protected in sowing, and young plants in
planting.</p>

<p><i>Swamping of Alkali Lands.</i>—It should, however, be remembered
that the <i>swamping</i> of alkali lands, whether of the white or black
kind, is fatal not only to their present productiveness, but also, on
account of the strong chemical action thus induced, greatly jeopardizes
their future usefulness. Many costly investments in orchards and
vineyards have thus been rendered unproductive, or have even become a
total loss.</p>

<p><i>Reduction of Alkali by Cropping.</i>—Another method for diminishing
the amount of alkali in the soil is the cropping with plants that take
up considerable amounts of salts. In taking them into cultivation, it
is advisable to remove entirely from the land the salt growth that
may naturally cover it, notably the greasewoods (<i>Sarcobatus</i>,
<i>Allenrolfea</i>), with their heavy percentage of alkaline ash (12
to 20 per cent). Crop plants adapted to the same object are mentioned
farther on. Such crops should also, of course, be wholly removed from
the land.</p>

<p><i>Total Amounts of Salts Compatible with Ordinary Crops; Tolerance
of Culture Plants.</i>—Since the amount of alkali that reaches the
surface layer is largely dependent upon the varying conditions of
rainfall or irrigation, and surface evaporation, it is difficult to
foresee to what extent that accumulation may go, unless we know the
total amount of salts present that may be called into action. This, as
already explained, can ordinarily be ascertained by the examination of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</span>
one sample representing the average of a soil column of four feet. By
calculating the figures so obtained to an acre of ground, we can at
least approximate the limits within or beyond which crops will succeed
or perish. Applying this procedure to the cases represented in the
diagrams (pp. 434, 452, chapter 22) and estimating the weight of the
soil per acre-foot at 4,000,000 pounds, we find in the land on which
barley refused to grow the figures 32,470 and 43,660 pounds of total
salts per acre, respectively corresponding to 0.203 per cent for the
first figure (the second, representing only the two surface feet, is
not strictly comparable). For the land on which barley gave a full
crop, we find for the May sample 25,550 pounds, equivalent to 0.159 per
cent for the whole soil column of four feet. It thus appears that for
barley the limits of tolerance lie between the above two figures. It
should be noted that in this case a full crop of barley was grown even
when the alkali consisted of fully one-half of the noxious carbonate
of soda; proving that it is not necessary in every case to neutralize
the entire amount of that salt by means of gypsum, which in the present
case would have required about 9½ tons of gypsum per acre—a
prohibitory expenditure.</p>

<p><i>Relative Injuriousness of the Several Salts.</i>—Of the three
sodium salts that usually constitute the bulk of “alkali,” only the
carbonate of soda is susceptible of being materially changed by any
agent that can practically be applied to land. So far as we know, the
salt of sodium least injurious to ordinary vegetation is the sulfate,
commonly called Glauber’s salt, which ordinarily forms the chief
ingredient of “white” alkali. Thus barley is capable of resisting
about five times more of the sulfate than of the carbonate, and quite
twice as much as of common salt. Since the maximum percentage that can
be resisted by plants varies materially with the kind of soil, it is
difficult to give exact figures save with respect to particular cases.
For the sandy loam of the Tulare substation, California, for instance,
the maximum for cereals may be approximately stated to be one-tenth
of 1 per cent for salsoda; a fourth of 1 per cent for common salt; and
from forty-five to fifty one-hundredths of one per cent of Glauber’s
salt. For clay soils the tolerance is in general markedly less,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</span>
especially as regards the salsoda; since in their case the injurious
effect on the tilling qualities of the soil, already referred to, is
superadded to the corrosive action of that salt upon the plant.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90"><i>Effect of Differences in Composition
of Alkali Salts on</i> <i>Beets.</i>—The marked differences which
may occur as the result of even slight variations in the proportions
of the several salts is well illustrated in the subjoined diagram of
observations made by Dr. G. W. Shaw, of the Cal. Expt. station, upon
beet fields in the neighborhood of Oxnard, Cal. The lands lie not far
from the seashore, and saline water underruns them for considerable
distance inland. The soil and subsoil are quite sandy, so that it takes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</span>
irrigation water only about seven hours to penetrate from the
surface to bottom water at seven feet depth. The land on which these
observations were made are apparently level to the eye, though probably
the alkali belts on which the sugar beets were “poor” are slightly
depressed swales.</p>

<p>It will be noted that here the beets were “good” where the sulfate
(Glauber’s salt) ranged up to .8%, with .10 to .20 of common salt; but
that so soon as the latter rose above .20, the beets were poor despite
the low percentage of Glauber’s salt; then became “good” again so soon
as the common salt fell below .20%, although the Glauber’s salt increased.</p>

<h4>TOLERANCE OF VARIOUS CROP PLANTS.</h4>

<p>The following table, compiled by Dr. R. H. Loughridge mainly from his
own observations,<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>
gives the details of the tolerance for various culture plants as
ascertained at the several experiment substations in California, as
well as at other points in that State and in Arizona where critical
cases could be found. It is thought preferable to investigate
analytically such cases in the field, rather than to attempt to obtain
results from small-scale experiments artificially arranged, in which
sources of error arising from evaporation and other causes are most
difficult to avoid.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">The table is so arranged as to show the
maximum tolerance thus far observed for each of the three single
ingredients, as well as the maximum of total salts found compatible
with good growth. In view of the extremely variable proportions between
the three chief ingredients found in nature, this seems to be the only
manner in which the observations made can be intelligibly presented,
until perhaps a great number of such data shall enable us to evolve
mathematical formulæ expressing the tolerance for the possible mixtures
for each plant. For it is certain that the tolerance-figures will be
quite different in presence of other salts, from those that would
be obtained for each salt separately; or for the calculated mean of
such separate determinations, proportionally pro-rated. It must also
be remembered that in all alkali soils, lime carbonate is abundantly
present, as is, nearly always, a greater or less amount of the sulfate
(gypsum). As already stated, according to the investigations of Cameron
not only these compounds, but also calcium chlorid, exert a protective
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</span>
influence against the injury to plant growth from compounds of sodium
and potassium. The figures here given can therefore be regarded only as
approximations, subject to correction by farther observation. They are
arranged from the highest tolerances downward, for each of the three
ingredients, as well as for the totals. The latter are not, of course,
the sums of the figures given in the preceding columns, but independent data.</p>

<i>Comments on the Above Table.</i>—Considering in this table, first,
the plants suitable for the stronger class of alkali lands, it may be
said generally that the search for widely acceptable kinds has not
been very successful. It is true that cattle will nibble green salt
grass (<i>Distichlis spicata</i>), but will soon leave it for any dry
feed that may be within reach. The enormous amount of salts which
it will tolerate in the soil on which it grows, and the doubtless
correspondingly large amount of those salts which it will absorb,
judging from its taste, sufficiently explain the reluctance of cattle
to feed on it to any considerable extent.</p>

<p>The same is true of all the fleshy plants that grow on the stronger
alkali lands, and are known under the general designation of “alkali
weeds.” When stock unaccustomed to it are forced by hunger to feed on
such vegetation to any considerable extent, disordered digestion is
apt to result; which in such ranges, however, is often counteracted by
feeding on aromatic or astringent antidotes, such as the gray sagebrush
and the more or less resinous herbage of plants of the sunflower family.</p>

<p>In the Great Basin region, lying between the Sierra Nevada and the
front range of the Rocky Mountains, there are, aside from the grasses,
numerous herbaceous and shrubby plants that afford valuable pasturage
for stock,<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>
and some of these grow on moderately strong alkali land; the same is
true in California. It is quite possible that some of these will be
found to lend themselves to ready propagation for culture purposes as
well as they do for restocking the ranges. But thus far none have found
wider acceptance, probably because their stiff branches and upright
habit render them inconvenient to handle. It will require more extended
experience and experiment before any of these will be definitely
adopted for propagation by farmers and stockmen.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</span></p>

<h4><i>Saltbushes, and Herbaceous Crops.</i></h4>

<p><i>Australian Saltbushes.</i>—Experience in California indicates that
in the more southerly portion of the arid region, unpalatable native
plants may be largely replaced, even on the ranges, by one or more
species of the Australian saltbushes (<i>Atriplex spp.</i>), long ago
recommended by Baron von Mueller of Melbourne; of which one (<i>A.
semibaccata</i>) has proved eminently adapted to the climate and soil
of California and is readily eaten by all kinds of stock. The facility
with which it is propagated, its quick development, the large amount
of feed yielded on a given area, even on the strongest alkali land
ordinarily found, and its thin, flexible stems, permitting it to be
handled very much like alfalfa, seem to commend it especially to the
farmers’ consideration wherever better forage plants cannot be grown
and the climate will permit of its use. It does not, however, resist
the severe cold of the interior plateau country, and is wholly out of
place in the Pacific Coast region where summer fogs prevail. Most of
the other Australian species have an upright, shrubby habit, which
adapts them better to browsing than to pasture proper. The same is
true of the Argentine species (<i>A. Cachiyuyum</i>), which in its
native pampas is highly esteemed for that purpose, and succeeds well
in California. Of other Australian saltbushes, <i>A. halimoides</i>,
<i>vesicaria</i> and <i>leptocarpa</i> are the most promising; the
latter is somewhat similar in habit to the semibaccata, but is not as
vigorous a grower. Since some of the saltbushes take up nearly one
fifth of their dry weight of ash ingredients,<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>
largely common salt, the complete removal from the land of a five-ton
crop of saltbush hay will take away nearly a ton of the alkali salts
per acre. This will in the course of some years be quite sufficient to
reduce materially the saline contents of the land, and will frequently
render possible the culture of ordinary crops.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</span></p>

<p><i>Modiola.</i>—Alongside of the saltbushes, the Chilean plant
<i>Modiola procumbens</i>, now generally known as modiola simply,
deserves attention, as it makes acceptable pasture where alfalfa
fails to make a stand on account of alkali. It is a trailing plant
with medium-sized, roundish foliage, and roots freely at the joints
where they touch the ground. Unlike the saltbushes it is therefore a
formidable weed where it is not wanted; but as according to California
experience it resists as much as 52,000 pounds of salts per acre, even
when 41,000 of these is common salt, it is likely to be useful in many
cases, particularly as an admixture to a saltbush diet for stock, as it
does not absorb as much salt as the latter. It seems best adapted to pasturage.</p>

<p>As the table shows that, once grown to the age of a few years, alfalfa
will resist a percentage of alkali next to the saltbush, it will
generally be worth while, in lands otherwise adapted to alfalfa, to
prepare the land by leaching-down (see above) so as to secure a stand
of the more valuable crop.</p>

<p><i>Native Grasses.</i><a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>—Of
all known plants that stock will eat somewhat freely, the tussock grass
(<i>Sporobolus airoides</i>, of which a figure is given farther on),
a native of the southern arid region, endures the largest amounts of
alkali; having been found growing well on land containing the enormous
amount of nearly half a million pounds of salts per acre, although it
will thrive with only 49,000 pounds in the soil. What it will do under
cultivation has never been fairly tested; but its bare tussocks, killed
by the excessive browsing of stock, testify to its acceptableness as
forage. It does not seem to absorb excessive amounts of salts.</p>

<p>Aside from the alkali grass proper (<i>Distichlis</i>), mentioned
above, the so-called rye grass of the Northwest (<i>Elymus
condensatus</i>) is probably, next to the tussock grass, the most
resistant species among the wild grasses. Its southern form, with
several others not positively identified, occupies largely the milder
alkali lands of southern California. This grass, though rather coarse,
is regularly cut for hay in the low grounds of Oregon and Washington.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</span></p>

<p>Doubtless some of the indigenous grasses of the interior plateau
region and of the great plains east of the Rocky Mountains, such as
the buffalo and grama grasses, as well as several of the wheat grasses
(<i>Agropyron</i>) and bunch grasses (<i>Festuca</i>, <i>Poa</i>,
<i>Stipa</i>, etc.) will prove resistant to larger proportions of
alkali than the meadow and pasture grasses of the regions of summer
rains.</p>

<p><i>Cultivated Grasses.</i>—The superficial rooting and fine
fibrous roots of the true annual grasses render them, as a whole,
rather sensitive to alkali; yet the cereals—barley, wheat, rye and
oats—resist, as the table shows, the average alkali salts to the
extent of from 17,000 total salts, with not exceeding 1500 pounds of
carbonate, in the case of the more delicate varieties of wheat, to over
25,000 pounds per acre in the case of barley, which with the gluten
wheats and rye seems to have the highest tolerance-figure. The special
adaptation of gluten wheats to arid conditions is thus emphasized. The
roots of these cereals are comparatively stout, with thick epidermis.</p>

<p>Among the cultivated forage grasses proper, the Australian variety of
the English ray (generally miscalled rye) grass seems most resistant.
The eastern fescues, Kentucky blue grass, and others at home in the
humid region are easily injured, as those who try to maintain lawns
on alkali-tainted lands, or by irrigation with alkali waters, know
to their sorrow. To these grasses common salt and bittern (magnesium
chlorid) seem to be particularly injurious, and they tolerate but
little “black alkali.”</p>

<p>On the rather close-textured soil at Chino, California, the loliums,
including the darnel (“California cheat”), and the Australian and
Italian ray (“rye”) grasses, succeed fairly on land containing as much
as 6,000 pounds of (white) salts. Most other cultivated grasses failed
conspicuously alongside of these. It must be remembered that in more
loose-textured, sandy lands than those in which these tests were made,
the above figures for tolerance would probably be increased by 30
percent or more.</p>

<p><i>Maize</i> is rather sensitive to alkali, and suffers even on
slightly alkaline land, owing doubtless to the large development of
fine white rootlets near the surface, so familiar to corn-growers. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</span>
<i>Sorghums</i>, and especially Egyptian corn (durra) are much less
sensitive, as the table shows, and are among the first crops to be
tried on alkali lands. The related millets share this resistance more
or less, and we often see on cultivated lands in the alkali region
fine stands of barnyard grass (<i>Panicum crusgalli</i>) of which the
variety (?) <i>P. muticum</i> is said by observers of the U. S. Dept.
of Agriculture to be specially resistant, and acceptable to stock. One
of the most successful grasses on the light alkali lands near Chino,
where most of the commonly cultivated grasses fail, was a near relative
of the barnyard grass, the <i>Eleusine coracana</i>, which produces
heavy crops of a millet-like grain much relished by poultry, and also
by stock. This grass, largely grown in Egypt, has succeeded well
all over the ground whose alkali content ranges up to 12,000 pounds
per acre, but failed where the salts reached 38,840 pounds in the
surface foot. Next to this, in point of success, were the pearl millet
(<i>Pennisetum typhoideum</i>) and teosinte, Hungarian brome grass,
and Japanese millet, on land containing about 9,000 pounds of (chiefly
“white”) salts per acre.</p>

<p><i>Other Herbaceous Crops. Legumes.</i>—Both the natural growth of
alkali lands and experimental tests seem to show that this entire
family (peas, beans, clovers, etc.) are among the more sensitive and
least available wherever black alkali exists; while fairly tolerant of
the white (neutral) salts. Apparently a very little salsoda suffices to
destroy the tubercle-forming organisms that are so important a medium
of nitrogen-nutrition in these plants. Excepting the melilots, alfalfa
with its hard, stout and long taproot, seems to resist best of all
these plants.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">As a general thing, taprooted plants, when
once established, resist best, for the obvious reason that the main
mass of their feeding roots reaches below the danger level. Another
favoring condition, already alluded to, is heavy foliage and consequent
shading of the ground; alfalfa happens to combine both of these
advantages. There has been some difficulty in obtaining a full stand of
alfalfa in the portion of the Chino substation tract containing from
4000 to 6000 pounds of (largely black) alkali salts per acre; but once
obtained, it has done very well.</p>

<p>The only other plant of this family that succeeds well on this land,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</span>
and even (at Tulare) on soil considerably stronger (probably between
20,000 and 30,000 pounds) are the two melilots, <i>M. indica</i>, and
<i>alba</i>; the latter (the Bokhara clover) is a forage plant of no
mean value in moist climates, but somewhat restricted in its use in
the arid region because of the very high aroma it develops, especially
in alkali lands; so that stock will eat only limited amounts, best
when intermixed with other forage, such as the saltbushes. The yellow
melilot is highly recommended by the Arizona Experiment Station as
a green-manure plant for winter growth; but farther north it is a
summer-growing plant only, and is refused by stock. As already stated,
very few plants belonging to this family are naturally found on alkali
lands, and attempts to grow them, even where only Glauber’s salt is
present, have been but very moderately successful.</p>

<p>For most of the legumes the limit of full success seems to lie between
3000 and 4000 pounds to the acre. A marked exception, however, occurs
in the case of the hairy vetch, as shown in the table, where it is
credited, on the basis of repeated experiments, with a tolerance of
nearly 70,000 pounds. This amount was attained, however, in rather
sandy soils. Probably some of the Algerian vetches will likewise prove
more resistant than those which are natives of humid climates.</p>

<p><i>Mustard Family.</i>—As in the case of the legumes, wild
plants of the <i>mustard</i> family are rare on alkali lands; and
correspondingly, the cultivated mustard, kale, rape, etc., fail even on
land quite weak in alkali. Their limit of tolerance seems to lie near
4,000 to 5,000 pounds per acre even of white salts. Hence turnips and
radishes do not flourish on alkali lands.</p>

<p><i>Sunflower Family.</i>—Several of the hardiest of the native
“alkali weeds” belong to the <i>sunflower</i> family, and the common
wild sunflowers (<i>Helianthus californicus</i> and <i>H. annuus</i>)
are common on lands pretty strongly alkaline. The cultivated Russian
sunflower, as the table shows, resists the effects of nearly 60,000
pounds of total alkali, of which 52,640 pounds was sulfate (Glauber’s
salt), and 5440 common salt. This, it will be seen, is a very high
tolerance, so that this sunflower, yielding such excellent poultry
feed, is very widely available. Correspondingly, the “Jerusalem
artichoke,” itself a sunflower, is among the available crops on
moderately strong alkali soils; and so, doubtless, are other members of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</span>
the same relationship not yet tested, such as the true artichoke,
salsify, etc. Chicory, belonging to the same family, yielded roots at
the rate of twelve tons per acre, on land of the Chino tract containing
about 8,000 pounds of salts per acre.</p>

<p><i>Root Crops.</i>—It seems to be generally true that root crops
suffer in quality, however satisfactory may be the quantity, harvested
on lands rich in salts, and especially in chlorids (common salt). It
was noted at the Tulare substation (California) that the tubers of the
artichoke were inclined to be “squashy” in the stronger alkali land,
and failed to keep well; the same was true of potatoes, which were very
watery; and also of turnips and carrots. It is a fact well known in
Europe, that potatoes manured with kainit (chlorids of potassium and
sodium) are unfit for the manufacture of starch, and are generally of
inferior quality. But this is found not to be the case when, instead of
the chlorids, the sulfate is used; hence the advice, often repeated by
the California station, that farmers desiring to use potash fertilizers
should call for the “high-grade sulfate” instead of the cheaper
kainit, which adds to the injurious salts already so commonly present
in lowland soils of the arid region. Such root crops are, however,
available for stock feed.</p>

<p>The common <i>beet</i> (including the mangel-wurzel) is known to
succeed well on saline seashore lands, and it maintains its reputation
on alkali lands also. Being especially tolerant of common salt, it may
be grown where other crops fail on this account; but the roots so grown
are strongly charged with common salt, and have, as is well known, been
used for the purpose of removing excess of the same from sea-coast-marsh
lands. Such roots are wholly unfit for sugar-making.</p>

<p>It is quite otherwise with Glauber’s salt (sodium sulfate); and as
this is very commonly predominant in alkali lands, either before or
after the gypsum treatment, this fact is of great importance, for it
frequently permits of the successful growing of the sugar beet; as has
been abundantly proved at the Chino ranch, where land containing as
much as 60,000 pounds of salts, mostly this compound, has yielded roots
of very high grade, both as to sugar percentage and purity. But the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</span>
analyses of the Oxnard soil show that more than 10,000 pounds of
common salt will be required to render sugar beets unsatisfactory for
sugar-making.</p>

<p>Passing to <i>stem crops</i>, we find that <i>asparagus</i>, originally
itself a denizen of the sea-board, resists considerable amounts (not
yet exactly determined) of common salt as well as of Glauber’s salt.
It is even claimed that when grown with a dressing of common salt the
asparagus is more tender and savory. But it is quite sensitive to
“black alkali,” which must be neutralized with gypsum to render it
harmless.</p>

<p><i>Celery</i> did well with 13,640 pounds, of which nearly 10,000 was
common salt. But with 30,000 pounds the plants were killed.</p>

<p><i>Rhubarb</i> was a conspicuous failure, even in the weak and mostly
“white” alkali lands of the Chino station tract.</p>

<p><i>Textile Plants.</i>—<i>Japanese hemp</i>, while young, seemed to
have a hard struggle with the alkali, but at the end of the season
stood eight feet high. The <i>ramie</i> plant, also, will bear
moderately strong alkali, apparently somewhat over 12,000 pounds per
acre. <i>Flax</i> has not been tested in cultivation; but the wide
distribution of wild flax all over the arid portions of the States
of Oregon and Washington, would seem to indicate that it is not very
sensitive. Another textile plant, the Indian mallow (<i>Abutilon
avicennae</i>), was found to fail on the Chino alkali soil. But its
close relative, cotton, does not seem to be specially sensitive,
according to the experience had with it in the Merced river bottom in
California; and its culture is extensive in Egypt, where no particular
care seems to be exercised in selecting the land for the crop. It is
just possible that the saline content of the soil has in California, as
well as in the Atlantic sea-islands, contributed to the superior length
of the fiber shown in the measurements made during the Census work of
1880.<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<h4><i>Tolerance of Shrubs and Trees.</i></h4>

<p><i>Grapevines.</i>—The European grape, <i>Vitis vinifera</i>, is quite
tolerant of white or neutral alkali salts, and will resist even a
moderate amount of the black so long as no hardpan is allowed to form.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</span>
At the Tulare substation it was found that grapevines did well in
sandy land containing 35,230 pounds of alkali salts, of which one half
was Glauber’s salt, 9,640 pounds carbonate of soda, 7,550 pounds of
common salt, and 750 pounds nitrate of soda. They were badly distressed
where, of a total of 37,020 pounds of alkali salts, 25,620 pounds
was carbonate of soda; while where the vines had died out, there was
found a total of 73,930 pounds, with 37,280 pounds of carbonate. The
European vine, then, is considerably more resistant of alkali even in
its worst (black) form, than barley and rye, at least on sandy land;
and it seems likely that the native grapevines of the Pacific coast,
<i>californica</i>, and <i>arizonica</i>, would resist even better; a
point still under experiment.</p>

<p>Experience, however, has shown that vines rapidly succumb when by
excessive irrigation the bottom water is allowed to rise, increasing
the amount of alkali salts near the surface, and shallowing the soil
at their disposal. Such over-irrigation has been a fruitful cause
of injury to vineyards in the Fresno region, and would doubtless if
practiced kill most of the vines at the Tulare substation, which are
now flourishing. In such cases, sometimes the formation of hardpan is
followed by that of a concentrated alkaline solution above it, strong
enough to corrode the roots themselves, and not only killing the vines,
but rendering the land unfit for any agricultural use whatsoever. The
swamping of alkali lands, whether of the white or black kind, is not
only fatal to their present productiveness, but, on account of the
strong chemical action thus induced, greatly jeopardizes their future
usefulness. Many costly investments in orchards and vineyards have thus
been rendered unproductive, or have even become a total loss.</p>

<p>It should be remembered in this connection that as the roots of vines
will, when unobstructed, go to depths of fifteen and even twenty feet,
a subsequent rise of the bottom water from leaky irrigation ditches
will drown out the ends of the deep roots and thus cause the whole root
system to become diseased, inevitably resulting in unproductiveness, if
not death, of the vine.</p>

<p><i>Citrus Trees.</i>—Although the high figure of nearly 27,000 pounds
for the tolerance of citrus trees, as given in the table, seems to
place them rather high on the list, such high tolerance actually occurs
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</span>
only in very sandy soils, and when common salt is in small proportion.
Generally speaking, the citrus tribe are rather sensitive to alkali
salts, and more especially to common salt. In fact, as to the high
tolerance-figure given in the table, observed in sandy land, the
alkali there contained only a trace of common salt. Young seedling
trees are particularly sensitive; so that it is often difficult to
obtain a stand even when, later on, the feeding roots descend beyond
the reach of injury. In the close-textured lands of Chino, young trees
hardly maintained life with more than 5,000 pounds of total salts.
Near Riverside, full-grown trees perished under the influence of
bottom water containing 0.25%, or 146 grains of salt per gallon, which
impregnated the ground; corresponding to about 9,000 pounds per acre in
four feet.</p>

<p>In the sandy loam lands near Corona, trees eight years old suffered
severely when by irrigation with alkali-water the alkali-content of
the land reached 11,000 pounds per acre; as illustrated in Figs. Nos.
44, and 45. At another point in the same region, two representative
trees were selected for comparison, five rows apart on land absolutely
identical; one of these retained its leaves, though suffering, the
other was completely leafless. The leaching of the alkali to the depth
of four feet gave the following results, calculated to pounds per acre:</p>

<table class="spb1">
   <tbody><tr>
      <td class="tdl">&nbsp;</td>
      <td class="tdc">&nbsp;Sulfates.&nbsp;</td>

   </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>

<p>Here it is apparently the excess of common salt to which the difference
is due, and this despite the higher content of carbonate of soda in the
soil bearing the better tree.</p>

<p>On the other hand, at the Tulare substation orange trees (sour stock)
maintain vigorous growth and good bearing in a very sandy tract which
to the depth of seven feet showed an aggregate content of 26,840 pounds
of salts (or 22,780 to four feet depth); but which is never irrigated.
(See diagram No. 66). The salts in this case consists wholly of sulfate
and carbonate of soda in the ratio of fifty-four to forty-two, implying
the presence of nearly 12,000 pounds of salsoda within reach of the
tree roots; yet in the absence of common salt, no perceptible injury or
even stress upon the trees has been noted.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</span></p>

<p>According to observations made in San Diego county, Calif., lemon trees
are even more sensitive to common salt than oranges, since a total
content of 8,000 pounds per acre, about one-third of which was common
salt, seemed to render the trees wholly unprofitable.</p>

<p>In view of these facts, showing that common salt is the portion of
alkali by far most injurious to citrus trees, great care should be
taken in the use of irrigation waters to exclude those charged with
that compound; and also to avoid locating citrus orchards on land
already impregnated with common salt.</p>

<p>The <i>olive</i> tree, as the table shows, is among the most resistant
to alkali salts, approaching the grape in this respect. This might have
been anticipated from its extended culture in the arid regions of the
old world, including Palestine and northern Africa, where alkali lands
abound. It is probable that the figure given in the table does not yet
show the extreme limit of its endurance.</p>

<p>California experience with the <i>date palm</i>, as the table shows,
credits it with an endurance not exceeding 8320 pounds of total salts.
This is doubtless an underestimate, for in the Sahara desert and Egypt
it is credited with being the culture which will succeed in stronger
alkali than any other cultural plant; and, according to Mr. Means of
the United States Department of Agriculture, it is sometimes irrigated
with water containing as much as 200 grains of salts per gallon. It
should be remembered, however, that these trees always grow in very
sandy lands; and in the desert regions it is often grown below the
surface of the ground, so as to render it wholly independent of the
alkali accumulations on the surface. The extreme limit of its endurance
must therefore remain in doubt until more extended experiments have
made more definite data available.</p>

<h4><i>Deciduous Orchard Trees.</i></h4>

<p>Among deciduous orchard trees, strangely enough, the <i>almond</i>
stands alongside of the fig in alkali-resistance, as indicated in the
table. The <i>peach</i> seems to be much more sensitive, ranking near
the <i>apricot</i> and <i>prune</i>, whose tolerance is less than half
as high. That the <i>pear</i> and <i>apple</i>, generally counted among
the more northern fruits in the humid region, should excel these stone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</span>
fruits in endurance of alkali, is rather unexpected; and the figures
concerning the whole group of these rosaceous fruits admonish us that
it is unsafe to predict, without trial, what may be the outcome of
culture tests. Thus plum trees, apparently in good condition, sometimes
suddenly begin to fail when starting to bear; the fruit appears normal
on the outside for a time, but the pit fails to form, being at times
flattened out like a piece of pasteboard; and the fruit does not
mature. Yet there is no observable injury to the base of the trunk, or
to the roots. On the other hand, pears do well even when the outside
bark around the root-crown is blackened by the action of the alkali
salts. But 38,000 pounds, even of sulfate, proves too much for the pear.</p>

<p>The <i>quince</i> appears to be materially more resistant than
the apple or pear. It probably ranges alongside of the fig, the
soil-adaptations of which it shares in other respects also.</p>

<p>The <i>English walnut</i> resents even a slight taint of <i>black</i>
alkali; but is fairly tolerant of “white” salts, as is shown in the
peculiarly suitable light loam soils on the lower Santa Clara river, in
Ventura county, as well as in Orange county, California.</p>

<p>Close figures for the limits of alkali tolerance in the case of
deciduous orchard trees cannot easily be given or determined, owing to
the difficulties inherent in the differences of root penetration in
the several soils and localities; as well as the fact already alluded
to, that in close-textured soils the tolerance is in general decidedly
less than in sandy lands. Hence the figures in the table must be taken
as more nearly representing <i>relative</i> tolerances, rather than
absolute data to be applied in every case. As regards the stone fruits,
it should be remembered that the Myrobalan root, being at home in Asia
Minor, where alkali abounds, should when practicable be used wherever
alkali conditions exist, in preference to all but the almond, which
seems to resist well, even on its own root, but has not as wide a range
of adaptations as a grafting stock as the myrobalan. While most of the
other stone fruits at the Tulare substation were on myrabalan roots,
the stock of those in outside orchards was mostly in doubt. It is also
to be kept in mind that different varieties of the same fruit—<i>e. g.</i>,
pears and apples—show a not inconsiderable variation in their resistance.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</span></p>

<h4><i>Timber and Shade Trees.</i></h4>

<p>Of trees, forest and shade, suitable for alkali lands, some native ones
call for mention. One is the California white or valley oak (<i>Quercus
lobata</i>), which forms a dense forest of large trees on the (almost
throughout somewhat alkaline) delta lands of the Kaweah River in
California, and is found scatteringly all over the San Joaquin Valley.
Unfortunately this tree does not supply timber valuable for aught but
firewood or fence posts, being quite brittle.</p>

<p>The native <i>cottonwoods</i>, while somewhat retarded and dwarfed in
their growth in strong alkali, are quite tolerant of the white salts,
especially of Glauber’s salt. As they usually grow near to the water,
their tolerance for alkali salts is difficult to ascertain.</p>

<p>Of other trees, the <i>oriental plane</i>, or sycamore, and the
<i>black locust</i> have proved the most resistant in the alkali lands
of the San Joaquin Valley; and the former being a very desirable shade
tree, it should be widely used throughout the regions where alkali
prevails more or less. The <i>ailantus</i> is about equally resistant,
and but for the evil odor of its flowers, deserves strong commendation.</p>

<p>Of the <i>eucalypts</i>, the narrow-leaved <i>Eucalyptus amygdalina</i>
(one of the “red gums”) and the closely related <i>viminalis</i>, seem
to be least sensitive, and in some cases have grown in alkali lands as
rapidly as anywhere. The <i>rostrata</i>, as well as the pink flowered
variety of <i>sideroxylon</i>, are now doing about as well as the
<i>amygdalina</i> at Tulare, where at first they seemed to suffer. The
common blue gum, <i>globulus</i>, is much more sensitive.</p>

<p>Of the <i>Acacias</i>, the tall-growing <i>A. melanoxylon</i> (“black
acacia”) resists pretty strong alkali, even on stiff soil; as can be
seen at Tulare and Bakersfield, California, where there are trees
nearly two feet in diameter. The beautiful <i>A. lophantha</i>
(<i>Albizzia</i>) has in plantings made along the San Joaquin Valley
railroad shown considerable resistance, likewise; but it is quite
sensitive to frost.</p>

<p>Of other Australian trees, one of the Australian “pines,” (<i>Casuarina
equisetifolia</i>), is doing well on fairly strong alkali land in the
San Joaquin Valley.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</span></p>

<p>A remarkably alkali-resistant shrub or small tree is the pretty
<i>Kœlreuteria paniculata</i> from China, which at Tulare is growing
in some of the strongest alkali soil of the tract. Unfortunately it is
available mainly for ornamental purposes; its wood, while small, is
very hard and makes excellent fuel.</p>

<p>Of trees indigenous to the Atlantic and East Central United States,
the Tulip tree, the Linden, and most other trees of the humid region,
including the English oak (<i>Quercus pedunculata</i>) become stunted
in alkali soils. The <i>honey locust</i>, being particularly adapted
to calcareous lands, does moderately well on alkali lands, but its
thorns and imperfect shade render it not very desirable. The <i>black
locust</i> and the <i>elms</i> have on the whole done best. The
eastern maples are not successful; but the California maple (<i>Acer
macrophyllum</i>) and the box elder (<i>Negundo californica</i>) have
done fairly well in the lighter alkali lands of the San Joaquin Valley.</p>

<p>The <i>Conifers</i>—Pines, firs, cedars, cypress, etc., are very
sensitive to black alkali and will not endure much even of the “white”
salts. Even the native juniper of the mesas carefully adheres to the
portions—breaks and upper slopes, hilltops, etc.—which are more or
less leached by the scanty rains of these regions.</p>

<h4>INDUCEMENTS TOWARD THE RECLAMATION<br> OF ALKALI LANDS.</h4>

<p>The expense involved in the reclamation of strong alkali lands
naturally gives rise to the question whether adequate advantages are
likely to be derived from such expenditure; specially when the last
resort—underdraining and leaching—has to be adopted.</p>

<p>Those familiar with the alkali regions are aware how often the
occurrence of alkali spots interrupts the continuity of fields and
orchards, of which they form only a small part, but enough to mar their
aspect and cultivation. Their increase and expansion under irrigation
frequently renders their reclamation the only alternative of absolute
abandonment of the investments and improvements made, and from that
point of view alone it is of no slight practical importance. Moreover,
the occurrence of vast continuous stretches of alkali lands within the
otherwise most eligibly situated valley lands of the irrigation region
forms a strong incentive towards their utilization.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</span></p>

</div>

<p>There is, however, a strong intrinsic reason pointing in the
same direction, namely, the almost invariably high and lasting
productiveness of these lands when once rendered available to
agriculture. This is foreshadowed by the usually heavy and luxuriant
growth of native plants around the margins and between alkali spots
(<a href="#FIG_60">see fig. 60</a>); <i>i. e.</i>, wherever the amount of injurious
salts present is so small as not to interfere with the utilization of the
abundant store of plant-food which, under the peculiar conditions of
soil-formation in arid climates, remains in the land instead of being
washed into the ocean. Extended comparative investigations of soil
composition, as well as the experience of thousands of years in the
oldest settled countries of the world, demonstrate this fact and show
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</span>
that so far from being in need of fertilization, alkali lands usually
possess extraordinary productive capacity whenever freed from the
injurious influence of the excess of useless salts left in the soil in
consequence of deficient rainfall. (See analyses, chapter 22,

</div>

<p><i>Climatic and Soil-Conditions.</i>—Next to climatic conditions,
chief among which are temperature and moisture, the physical and
chemical nature of the soil and subsoil is the most potent factor in
determining the natural vegetation of any region. The limitations we
observe in the adaptation of cultivated lands to certain crops, even
with artificial help, must be much more strongly pronounced when no
such aid is given, and the struggle for the survival of the fittest
is continued, subject only to seasonal variations, for thousands of
years. It is obvious that within the limits of the regional flora,
<i>the natural vegetation of any tract represents the best adaptation
of plants to soils, in the results of long periods of the struggle for
existence between competing species</i>; the survivors being those best
adapted to the entire environment.</p>

<p>In countries uninhabited by man the chief conditions outside of the
direct influence of climate and soil that may materially affect the
results of the competition are connected with the animal creation;
and within the latter, insects are probably the most influential,
beneficially in the part they play in the fertilization of flowers,
injuriously in their role as parasites. Since in the absence of man,
the effects of fire would ordinarily be conditioned upon the occurrence
of thunderstorms, its effects would then properly come under the head
of climatic influences. But while these and some other disturbing
factors must not be forgotten in considering the relations of soils to
the natural vegetation borne by them, the common consensus of mankind
has long recognized the intimate connection existing between the two,
and has everywhere made it the basis of at least a general estimate of
the agricultural value of the land concerned.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</span></p>

<h4>NATURAL VEGETATION<br> THE BASIS OF AGRICULTURAL<br>
LAND VALUES IN THE UNITED STATES.<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></h4>

<p>In countries long settled, as in Europe, where the nature of the
original forest is unknown or a matter of tradition only, the
adaptations of the several kinds of land to culture plants and forest
trees has been gradually ascertained by cultural experience, and
their designations, values and uses determined accordingly. In the
United States, the character of the original forest growth is mostly
in evidence, or is definitely known by tradition, even in the older
states. West of the Alleghenies, there is as yet little difficulty in
this regard, partly because even where the original forest growth has
disappeared its character remains on record, the assessed land values
being very commonly based upon the tree growth of the wild land. In the
Southern States especially, the classification of uplands into “pine
lands” and “oak lands” is universal, and is associated with certain
limits of valuation, both by assessors and purchasers. Within each
of these two classes, however, there are well-defined gradations of
cultural value according to the kind (species) <i>e. g.</i>, of pine
or oak that occupies the ground, either alone, or in intermixture with
other trees whose presence or absence is considered significant. In
the case of “bottoms” or alluvial lands, corresponding distinctions
and classifications obtain; we hear of hickory, beech, gum, and cherry
bottoms, hackberry hammocks, etc. each name being associated with
certain cultural values or peculiarities of soil, well understood by
the farming population.</p>

<h4>INVESTIGATION OF CAUSES GOVERNING THE<br>
DISTRIBUTION OF NATIVE VEGETATION.</h4>

<p>It seems singular that such well and widely understood designations
and important distinctions should not long ago have been made the
subject of careful investigation and precise definition by agricultural
investigators. For apart from their practical importance as guides to
the purchaser of land, or settler, this correlation of land-values and
natural vegetation is of the utmost interest in offering an opportunity
for researches on the factors which determine the choice of these
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</span>
several trees and the corresponding shrubby and herbaceous growths.
Moreover, the cultural results and adaptations corresponding to certain
natural growths being known from experience, a thorough knowledge
of the soils so characterized should enable us to project into new
lands, where experience is lacking, the benefits of experience already
had; even in cases where, from some cause, the natural vegetation is
different, or absent. Only very fragmentary and casual observations
in this line are on record thus far, almost the only generally
recognized chemical characterization of plant habit being that of
calciphile (lime-loving), and calcifuge (lime-repelled) ones, but with
few attempts at more than local application. Yet, to ascertain by
the physical and chemical examination of soils what are determining
factors of certain natural vegetative preferences, which are invariably
followed by certain agricultural results, should not be an unsolvable
problem, and its practical importance should justify its most active
investigation.</p>

<p><i>Investigations in Mississippi.</i>—In his explorations connected
with the Geological and Agricultural Survey of the State of
Mississippi, as well as, later on, in similar researches carried
on in other states, the writer was forcibly struck with the close
correspondence of the limits of geological formations with those of
vegetative zones; so much so that he was led to rely very largely on
the latter as indicative of the probable occurrence of outcrops that
otherwise, in a level country, would have passed unperceived.</p>

<p>These observations upon the correlations between virgin soils and their
native vegetation having originally been made by the writer, in great
detail, in the state of Mississippi, from 1855 to 1872, and that state
being from natural causes a peculiarly cogent illustration of such
correlation: it seems advisable to describe first, somewhat in detail,
the facts observed there, and subsequently to compare them with what
has been observed elsewhere by him or others.</p>

<p>No claim is made to an even approximately exhaustive presentation of
the whole subject, even within the United States; nor is it intended to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</span>
give complete lists of vegetation.<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>
The object is to give such facts as have been fairly well established
by observation, hoping that more thorough investigations in the same
line will thereby be stimulated.</p>

<div class="blockquot fs_90">
<p><i>Limestone Belt.</i>—beginning on the east we have, first, a
narrow belt of limestones of the carboniferous formation, on which
there is a fine growth of various oaks, with walnut, hickory, sweet
gum, tulip tree and red cedar, and a very productive soil.</p>

<p>“<i>Pine Hills.</i>”—Next adjoining on the west comes a belt of
sandy, non-calcareous beds of the lower Cretaceous formation, about 18
miles wide. It has a hilly surface, and outside of the narrow valleys,
the prevalent timber is short-leaved pine and scrubby black-jack oak,
with some post oak and small black gum, and a few large chestnut
trees.</p>

<p><i>“Prairie” Belt.</i>—Westward of this belt we descend into a
level “prairie” region, six to twelve miles wide; the “white lime
country,” having heavy black clay soils, underlaid by the cretaceous
“rotten limestones;” which are profusely productive. The sparse tree
growth consists of stout, vigorous and dense-topped post and black-jack
oaks, with clumps of crab-apple, Chickasaw plum thickets, and an
occasional red cedar.</p>

<p><i>Pontotoc Ridge.</i>—West of the prairie belt we ascend into a ridgy
hill country, twelve to fourteen miles wide; the “Pontotoc ridge,”
formed of the soft limestones and marls of the upper cretaceous
formation, and covered with a deep red soil, which bears a rich growth
of oaks, with hickory interspersed, and black walnut, umbrella and
tulip tree even on the ridges. This is one of the finest agricultural
regions of the State.</p>

<p><i>Flatwoods.</i>—From the Pontotoc ridge and its fine lands and
timber we descend to westward into the “Flatwoods” belt, three to eight
miles wide; a level country underlaid by heavy gray non-calcareous
clays of the tertiary formation, from which most of its soil is
directly formed. It bears a pretty dense growth of the same species of
oaks that characterize the prairies farther east, but the form, habit
and size of the trees is so different that many of the inhabitants
believe them to be different species. The black-jack oak looks like
small, dense-topped apple trees; the post oak, on the contrary, has an
open top of the form of a short-handled, spreading broom. The soil is
poor and unthrifty, as are the few disappointed settlers, who bought
the land on the strength of its oak-tree growth. (See page 500).</p>

<p><i>Brown Loam Region. Table Lands.</i>—Adjoining the Flatwoods on
the west is a broad upland region, with a brownish-yellow soil and
subsoil, extending nearly to the edge of the Mississippi bottom. In its
eastern portion it is rather broken and hilly, with sandy ridge soils,
a mixed growth of oaks and short-leaved pine, and occasional chestnuts;
a fair farming country only. To westward the ridges become lower and
broader, assuming a plateau character. The pine disappears, and black,
Spanish, red and white oak, with much hickory, largely replaces the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</span>
black jack and post oak; thus characterizing the fertile brown-loam
“table-lands” that extend through western Tennessee and Mississippi
into Louisiana, and have long been noted for their high production of
fine upland cotton.</p>

<p><i>Cane Hills.</i>—On the western border of the table-land region,
and here forming a strip only a few miles wide along the edge of the
Mississippi bottom, but from 70 to 450 feet above it, lies the remnant
of what farther south constitutes a wide and important agricultural
belt; the Bluff or Loess formation, locally known as “the Cane Hills.”
The soil is largely composed of grains of sand and silt cemented by
lime carbonate; it is therefore calcareous, and as on the Pontotoc
ridge, described above, we find here the black walnut, the tulip tree,
ash and others, elsewhere restricted to the alluvial “bottoms,” on
the ridges themselves, from sixty to a hundred feet above the stream beds.</p>

<p><i>Mississippi Bottom.</i>—At the western foot of this bluff there
lies the great Mississippi Bottom, with its rich soils and varied
forest growth. This also, however, subdivides into at least three
distinct soil and vegetative zones, viz., the sandy “Frontlands,” which
lie on the immediate banks of the great river and its main branches,
and the heavy clayey “Back-land” areas, whose soils are partly the
product of modern swamp deposits from backwaters, partly result from
the disintegration of strongly calcareous clays constituting the lower
part of the Bluff or Loess formation. A third natural subdivision
is the “Dogwood ridge,” a narrow belt of slightly elevated land,
mostly above ordinary overflows, which extends diagonally from the
Mississippi river to the Yazoo bottom, and seems to be the continuation
of “Crowleys ridge” in Arkansas. Each of these soil belts has its own
characteristic forest growth, as indicated in the table below the map.</p>
</div>

<p>We have here along an east-and-west line of about 200 miles, eleven
markedly distinct zones of vegetation, readily recognized as such by
every farmer, and each underlaid by a distinct geological terrane. It
does seem as though a close study of these and of the soils overlying
them should lead to some definite results showing the physico-chemical
causes of these differences.</p>

<p><i>Lime apparently a governing Factor.</i>—The connection of some
of these changes in vegetation with the calcareous nature of the
corresponding formation has already been referred to. As regards four
of the eleven divisions, this is obvious even to the casual observer,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</span>
and is well known to the population, who speak of the “lime country” or
belts being, as a matter of common knowledge, the best land; in full
accord with what, in Kentucky and elsewhere, has passed into a popular
maxim.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<p>Taking as a guide the trees and plants which characterize the obviously
calcareous lands, our next step should be to verify, if possible, the
fact that wherever these occur naturally, lime is abundant in the
soil in comparison with those lands in which such vegetation does
not occur naturally, or perhaps even fails to flourish when planted
without special fertilization. This the writer has sought to do,
first in connection with the survey work of the state of Mississippi,
and subsequently in the wider field that has since come under his
observation.</p>

<h4>SOIL BELTS IN SOUTHERN MISSISSIPPI.</h4>

<p>In Mississippi, the general conclusions derived from the observations
made on the northern cross section, are corroborated many times over
in other portions of the state. Aside from the cretaceous prairie
region, there runs across the middle of the state a belt of varying
width, of calcareous tertiary beds, which also give rise to more
or less extensive tracts of “black prairie” lands, interspersed
with non-calcareous, mostly sandy ridges, the lower slopes of
which, influenced by the calcareous beds, bear an oak and hickory
growth, while the higher portions have only pine, and usually remain
uncultivated. Southward of this “central prairie” belt lies the
long-leaf-pine forest area of the state, underlaid throughout by
sandy, non-calcareous formations, with poor sandy soils, save here and
there in patches, which can be at once recognized by the replacement
of the long-leaved pine by a vigorous oak growth; as is also the
case where the pine area abuts against the calcareous “Cane Hills”
on the west. The bottom soils of this region are largely “sour,”
and bear the gallberry (<i>Prinos glaber</i>), bay galls (<i>Persea
Carolina</i>), ti-ti (<i>Cliftonia monophylla</i>), candleberry
(<i>Myrica cerifera</i>), various whortle-berries, the pitcher plants
(<i>Sarracenia</i>), yellow star grass (<i>Aletris</i>), sundews,
<i>Xyris</i>, <i>Eriocaulon</i>, and other plants of similar habits.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</span></p>

<p><i>Vegetative and Soil Features of the Mississippi Coast
Belt.</i>—South of the long-leaf pine area lie the coast flats, with
sour, sandy soils underlaid by stiff clays. On these “pine meadows”
of the Mississippi coast occur some of the most striking cases of
modifications of vegetation due to physical and chemical causes.</p>

<p>As is well known, the long-leaved pine habitually belongs to the
dry sandy uplands of the Gulf States; the deciduous cypress, on the
other hand, is most characteristic of the swamps, where its roots
are permanently submerged in water. But on the pine meadows of the
Mississippi coast we see these two incongruous trees growing side by
side, though sadly worsted by their mutual concessions; their heights
usually ranging from 12 to 15, rarely as much as 18 feet.<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>
Yet both preserve their characteristic forms, the cypress being an exact
miniature reproduction of the usual level-topped swamp form, except
as to the “knee” feature; while the pine differs only in stature from
its giant brethren of the pine hills, from which it can be traced down
through all grades of transition. The soil on which this growth occurs
is a sour, sandy one, one and a half to three feet in depth, underlaid
by a solid, impervious gray clay, above which is usually found several
inches of coffee-colored bottom water, which drains slowly into the
sluggish water-courses, themselves carrying brownish, sour, but very
clear waters. Analysis shows the soil to be sour and extremely poor,
especially in its lime and phosphates (<a href="#Page_352">see chapter 19, p. 352</a>); its
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</span>
herbaceous vegetation consists exclusively of very small-seeded,
“calcifuge” plants (sedges, orchids, Juncus, Hæmodoraceæ, Xyris,
Polygala, etc.). This land is wholly unproductive and affords but
indifferent pasturage, except the first season after burning-over;
probably because of the effect of the minute amount of ashes so added.
As the coast is approached, the clay subsoil has an increasing depth of
sandy soil-mass above it, and on these “sand hammocks” the long-leaved
pine gradually assumes more and more of its usual stature; the cypress
disappears, and the Cuban pine (here called pitch pine) gradually comes
in; while the sedgy vegetation diminishes and finally disappears. On
this land crops may be grown as in the long-leaf-pine uplands.</p>

<p>But on the immediate coast, evidently under the influence of the
aboriginal “shell mounds,” the yellow sandy soil becomes blackish from
the (humus-forming) effect of the lime thus supplied; and concurrently
the coast live-oak (<i>Q. virens</i>), grape vines, the Hercules club
(<i>Aralia spinosa</i>), “l’herbe a trois quarts” (<i>Verbesina
sp.</i>), and numerous leguminous plants (which are wholly absent from
the pine meadows) take possession of the land, which is very productive
and has been specially utilized in the growing of Sea Island cotton.
Here the clay stratum is 15 to 20 feet below the surface, and roots
penetrate to great depths in the pervious soil, whose great thickness
makes up for its low percentage of plant-food (see table below). This
land is distinctly limited by the extent of the shell heaps, past or
present, and shows a respectable percentage of lime.</p>

          of the Mississippi<br> Coast Belt, through Jackson County.</p>
</div>

<p>The annexed schematic profile (<a href="#FIG_78">fig. 78</a>) illustrates these changes of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</span>
soil and vegetation, which furnish a striking example of the effective
modification of vegetative features by physical and chemical
soil-conditions.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to find a more striking exemplification of the
effect of lime carbonate, not only upon the vegetation but also upon
the physical and chemical characters of the hopelessly unproductive
soil of the sand hammocks and pine meadows; no longer brown and sour,
but jet black and neutral, modifying favorably every physical quality.
Humus likewise nowhere shows its benefits more strikingly.</p>

<p><i>Table of Lime-Percentages.</i>—The table below shows the average
lime percentages observed in most of the several vegetative areas
mentioned above. To meet the objection sometimes made that the
vegetative changes noted may be due to the larger amounts of phosphoric
acid and potash frequently found in calcareous lands, the percentages
of the latter are also given. Considering the origin of limestones,
such a connection is not unexpected, but it is far from constant.
On the contrary, the frequent co-occurrence of much lime and high
production with small percentages of phosphoric acid and potash leads
to the conclusion, already discussed (<a href="#Page_365">see chapter 19, p. 365</a>),
that in presence of abundance of calcic carbonate, smaller percentages of
phosphoric acid may be considered adequate than when lime is deficient,
on account of greater availability. Almost the same may be said of
potash; and it is quite possible that the presence of large amounts of
lime tends to prevent the leaching-out of this base, in consequence of
greater facility for the formation of zeolites. Illustrations of this
kind have already been given (chapters 3, 22).</p>

<p><i>Definition of “Calcareous Soils.”</i>—It will be noted that the
very obvious and important changes of vegetation are brought about
by comparatively slight differences in lime-content. In fact, only
two of the soils enumerated above would, according to the estimates
usually given in books on soil composition, be considered as properly
calcareous. But the decisive feature in this matter must evidently be
the <i>native vegetation</i>, which expresses the nature of the land
much more clearly and authoritatively than any arbitrary definition or
nomenclature can possibly claim to do. <i>A soil must be considered
as being calcareous whenever it naturally supports the vegetation
characteristic of calcareous soils.</i>

<h4>DIFFERENCES IN THE FORM AND<br> DEVELOPMENT OF
 TREES.<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></h4>

<p>It will be noted that in the above table, as well as in the discussion
preceding it, identical species of trees are ascribed to vegetative
areas of widely different productive capacity. Perhaps the most
striking example is that the cretaceous prairies and the adjoining
flatwoods belt, standing respectively highest and lowest in the scale
of productiveness, are yet bearing specifically identical tree-growth,
to-wit, the post oak (<i>Quercus minor</i>) and the black-jack oak
(<i>Q. marylandica</i>). While to the field botanist<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a>
there can be no question as to the absolute specific identity of
the two trees as growing on the respective areas, yet the mode of
development of both is so different in the two cases, that, as before
remarked they are popularly supposed to be different “kinds.”</p>

<p><i>Forms of the Post Oak.</i>—The post oak of the prairie lands is a
tree 50 to 70 feet high, with a stout, excurrent, rather conical trunk,
often somewhat curved to one side above, and densely clothed from
within 12 or 15 feet of the ground with comparatively short, sturdy
branches set squarely to the trunk, much crooked (geniculate), often
reflexed downward; altogether forming a dense head, beneath whose thick
foliage, a bird or squirrel is quite secure from the hunter’s aim.—In
the flatwoods, on the contrary, the post oak has a thin, rather short
trunk, divided up at 15 or 20 feet height into long, rod-like branches,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</span>
spreading broom-fashion, and scantily clothed with short twigs bearing
tufts of leaves; thus forming an open head, in which no creature can
hide effectually. On the brown-loam table-lands, again, the post oak
has a straight, rather slender, excurrent trunk with long and more
or less crooked limbs projecting at a large angle, sometimes even
drooping, and freely divided up into lateral, leafy branches; the trees
attain from 40 to 55 feet in height. Again, on the high sandy ridges
which are interspersed in the eastern portion of the brown loam area,
we find, generally associated with a similarly depauperated form of the
black-jack oak, and with the Upland Willow oak (<i>Q. cinerea</i>), a
form of the post oak intermediate between that of the Flatwoods and the
Table lands; twelve to fifteen feet high, with thin trunk, “sprangling”
long, crooked branches, clothed with sparse tufts of leaves. These four
strikingly distinct types are shown schematically, in their extreme
development, in the subjoined figures.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to say that between these extreme forms there
are many degrees of transition, corresponding to the transitions
between the several soil-classes respectively represented by them; or
they may be developed into depauperated types. Thus, for example, the
forms of the post and black-jack oak found on the sandy ridges of the
yellow loam region, hardly need experience in the observer to interpret
them as characterizing a wretchedly poor soil.</p>

<p><i>Forms of the Black-jack Oak.</i>—Not less striking are the
characteristics of the forms of the <i>black-jack oak</i> as developed
upon these several kinds of land. The black-jack of the prairies is a
low tree with a dense rounded head, often somewhat flattened above, and
a low, thick-set trunk divided up into square-set branches, so densely
clad with foliage that no light penetrates into the interior, and birds
can safely hide and nest within it. The height rarely exceeds 35 feet,
the head being 20 to 30 feet across.</p>

<p>The Flatwoods form, on the contrary, rarely exceeds 15 feet in height,
with a very rough bark and a small, rather dense, rounded top, giving
the whole the appearance of a small apple tree. Practically the same
form is seen on poor, clay ridges of “hog-wallow” land.

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</span>
On the brown-loam lands the black-jack, like the post oak, has a
rather slender, often somewhat crooked, but excurrent trunk 35 to 50
feet high, with more or less crooked limbs of moderate length, well
provided with leafy branches, but forming altogether a rather open
crown. A depauperated form of this type occurs on the sandy ridges of
the yellow-loam region and is 12 to 15 feet high, with slender, crooked
branches, clothed with scanty foliage; as shown in <a href="#FIG_80">Figure No. 80</a>,
alongside of the other typical forms.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</span>
In all these variations of the tree forms, there is also a concomitant
variation in the forms and other characters of the leaves. Thus in
the compact forms of the black-jack oak, the trilobate leaf is almost
completely obliterated, the leaf being simply rounded-cuneate, somewhat
auriculate at base. In the sparse-branched upland forms the leaves are
deeply three-lobed, and the ferruginous tomentum of the lower surface
is much less pronounced. The lobation of the post oak also varies
considerably both in the numbers of lobes and in their obtuseness.
Similar differences prevail in the case of the black and Spanish oaks;
thus in the latter, the long terminal, falcate lobe is always most
pronounced on “rich” soils, while on poor ones the trilobate leaf
predominates.</p>

<p>Of course all these forms may be found bearing acorns, so that they
undoubtedly represent adult trees.</p>

<p><i>Characteristic Forms of other Oaks.</i>—Similar general features
are repeated in the case of the other species of oaks, and also more
or less in other kinds of trees; though mostly less pronouncedly than
with the two species above described. Among the more striking are
the two forms of the willow oak (<i>Q. phellos</i>), which on low,
undrained ground assumes the low, rounded, “apple-tree” form, while on
well-drained uplands of good fertility it is a beautiful, slender tree
producing almost the effect of the acacia type; it is then a sign of
first-class land. The scarlet oak rather reverses these types; on good,
“brown-loam” upland it is of rounded form, not very tall, with sturdy,
rough-barked trunk; while on poor hillside lands its tall, smooth,
white trunk stands out as a conspicuous admonition to the land-seeker to
beware of a poor purchase. The black and Spanish oaks also indicate,
by tall thin trunks, a deterioration of the land as compared with the
lower and more sturdy growth on areas relatively richer in lime.</p>

<p><i>Sturdy Growth on Calcareous Lands.</i>—One feature invariably
repeated, not only in Mississippi but throughout the United States, is
that <i>in many strongly calcareous soils the growth of all trees, as
well as of shrubs and of many herbaceous plants, is of a more sturdy
and thick-set habit</i> than that of the same species grown on thin,
sandy, or generally on non-calcareous land. This effect is quite as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</span>
apparent in the arid region of the Pacific Coast as in the Atlantic
States, on the prairies of the Middle West, and of the Gulf Coast.
The experienced farmer recognizes this habit of the tree-growth as a
sign of good land, and the reverse, viz., trees of lank, tall and thin
growth, as evidence to the contrary, from the Atlantic to the Pacific.</p>

<p><i>Cotton Plant.</i>—The cotton plant affords very striking evidences
of this influence of lime. On the bottom lands of a creek in Rankin
county, Mississippi, the writer found a “patch” of cotton with
luxuriant stalks reaching above the head of a man on horseback, but
almost devoid of “squares” or blooms. The soil was very dark and
rich-looking, but was derived from a non-calcareous tertiary terrane
surrounding the heads of the stream. A few rods below, the latter
crosses the line of a calcareous terrane, from which copious marly
debris have been washed down on the bottom soil. Here the cotton was
just half as high as above, and thickly covered with squares, blooms,
and bolls.</p>

<p>Another similar example was noted on the Chickasawhay river, in Wayne
county, Miss. Where that stream flows through the non-calcareous,
lignitiferous area of the tertiary formation, its bottom lands bear
cotton crops of medium productiveness only, the stalks being of the
usual height of about three feet, and only fairly bolled. But a short
distance below the point where the soft marls of the marine tertiary
are cut into by the stream, the cotton plants on the bottom lands
are from 18 to 20 inches high only, closely branched, and literally
thronged with cotton bolls, so that the fields appear a solid mass
of white. The only objection urged against this land is that to pick
such cotton “breaks the backs” of the pickers. The tree growth of the
bottom, of course shows a corresponding change.</p>

<p><i>Lime Favors Fruiting.</i>—In connection with the obvious changes
of form and stature caused by the presence of an abundant supply of
lime carbonate in soils, there is another that has been long noted in
cultivation, but is no less striking in the native vegetation. The
abundant fruiting of oaks on such lands as compared with the same
species on non-calcareous soils is a matter of common note in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</span>
Mississippi Valley states; and the same is true of other trees, and
of herbaceous plants as well. The fruit on the lime soils is often
smaller, unless much humus is present; but the statement made in
Europe that cultivated fruits, and especially grapes, are sweeter on
calcareous lands, is abundantly verified in the native fruits of the
Mississippi Valley states as well; where the various wild berries,
haws, plums, etc., are well known to the younger part of the population
to be much sweeter and higher-flavored in certain (calcareous)
localities than in others, besides being usually more abundant.</p>

<p>This is entirely in accord with the well-known fact that the
application of lime checks the excessive wood and leaf growth resulting
from excess of nitrogen as well as moisture; while on the other hand,
the injurious effects of overdressing with lime or marl are known to
be repressed by the use of stable manure, or by green-manuring. The
repression of excessive wood growth by lime would seem to offer a
simple explanation of the compact habit of growth on calcareous lands;
and the extraordinary sweetness of fruits grown in the arid region as
compared with the same in the humid, is fully in accord with the high
lime-content of the arid lands.</p>

<p><i>Stunted Growth.</i>—In practice it will be found in most cases
that a stunted native growth is due not so much to lack of plant-food
in the soil, as to unfavorable physical conditions. Among these,
<i>shallowness, and extreme heaviness</i> of the soil are the most
common causes. The “scab lands,” underlaid by impervious rock at a
depth too slight for culture plants, as in many plateaus of the Pacific
Northwest, and in rocky or mountainous regions generally, are cases in
point. Strata of impervious clay often produce the same result; but
in this case, should such clay be intrinsically capable of supporting
plant growth, the land can often be made available for orchard purposes
by blasting with dynamite (<a href="#Page_181">see chapter 10, p. 181</a>).</p>

<p>The post oak (and black-jack) flats of the Mississippi Valley states
are familiar examples of land whose dwarfed tree growth causes it to be
avoided by settlers; similarly, a dwarfed growth of red elm (<i>Ulmus
rubra</i>), hackberry and ash indicates in the flood plain of the Red
river of Louisiana a heavy “waxy” red clay, or “gumbo” land, scarcely
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</span>
available for agricultural purposes.<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>
The gray or white “cray-fishy” bottom and bench lands of the
Southwestern States, so poor in lime, phosphates and humus as to be
worthless under existing conditions, are characterized by an easily
recognized scrubby growth of Water and Willow Oaks (<i>Q. nigra</i>, or
<i>aquatica</i>, and <i>phellos</i>), with low, rounded tops; while the
same trees, when well developed, indicate highly productive lands.</p>

<p><i>Physical</i> vs. <i>Chemical Causes of Vegetative Features</i>.—The
extent to which the modifications of form alluded to above are
referable to chemical and physical causes respectively, can be
approached by the discussion of the presence or absence of certain
trees from soils of extreme physical character, but otherwise normally
constituted. As has been shown above, the black-jack and post oaks
belong, as species, equally to the heaviest and lightest soils within
the state of Mississippi; to the black and yellow “prairie” soils, as
well as to the sandy ridges of the yellow-loam region; showing for
these two species as such, an independence of physical conditions and
an extraordinary adaptability, found in few other trees. They are
frequently found either alone or associated with only a few other
species of local adaptation, such as, in the prairie lands, the
crab-apple, wild plum, and the juniper or red cedar. On the soils
of intermediate or loam character, on the contrary, they are always
associated with other oaks as well as with hickory, and in that
association attain what may be considered their normal type or form.</p>

<p>From the fact that the dense, rounded top is formed by the black-jack
oak both on the rich prairie lands and on the poor soils of the
Flatwoods, it would seem that that form is the outcome of a physical
cause, viz., the extreme “heavy-clay” character of both kinds of land;
and we may note that exactly the reverse effect is observed in the
form growing on the poor sandy ridges, as shown in fig’s 79 and 80.
Yet it will also be noted that in the case of the post oak, the poor,
heavy-clay soil of the Flatwoods produces an open, broom-shaped top,
while the form assumed on the sandy ridges is substantially the same
for both species. Care must therefore be exercised in drawing general
conclusions as to the effects produced by either physical or chemical
causes, <i>alone</i>, upon tree forms.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</span></p>

<p><i>Lowland Tree Growth.</i>—The variations occurring in the valleys
or alluvial bottoms are less obvious to superficial observation,
yet equally important and cogent to the close observer. In the
properly alluvial lands, one dominant condition, that of <i>adequate
moisture</i> supply, is almost always fulfilled, irrespective of
soil quality. In addition to this, as stated in chapter 2
(<a href="#Page_24">see page 24</a>), practically all the alluvial lands of the
humid region may be considered as being of a more or less <i>calcareous</i>
character, as compared with the adjacent uplands. These two important
conditions dominate in a great measure the minor ones of variation
in soil-texture. Yet where, as is largely the case in the southern
part of the State of Mississippi, the amount of calcic carbonate is
insufficient to overcome the sourness of the soil, the vegetative
contrasts become extremely striking and characteristic, as explained above.</p>

<p><i>Contrast Between “First” and “Second” Bottoms.</i>—A very striking
phase of transition between the alluvial bottoms and the uplands proper
in the Cotton States are the second bottoms or hammocks of the streams,
whose soil and tree-growth in most cases differ markedly from those
of the first bottom; and these being usually closely adjacent, often
afford a very striking contrast to the latter. From some antecedent
geological cause not fully understood, these hammocks, usually elevated
from 4 to 10 feet above the present flood plain, have almost throughout
soils of a fine sandy, pulverulent or silty nature, frequently in
strong contrast to heavy clay soils in the first bottom.</p>

<p>They seem, moreover, to have been at some time subject to prolonged
maceration under water, resulting in the reduction of the ferric oxid,
and its accumulation in the lower portion of the deposit in the form of
bog-ore spots or “black gravel.” Since such a process always results
in the abstraction of phosphoric acid from the general mass of the
soil, to be accumulated in the bog ore in an inert condition,<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>
these hammock soils, usually whitish or gray in color, are almost throughout
poor in phosphates as well as in lime; the latter having been
definitively leached out. The resulting vegetation, as may be imagined,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</span>
is widely different from that of the bottom proper, as well as,
frequently, from that of the adjacent uplands; and though level and
fair to see, these hammocks are usually unthrifty and last but a short
time under exhaustive cultivation. Accordingly, their forest growth is
prevalently that of the poorer class of uplands, viz., small-sized post
and black-jack oaks, and in the low ground depauperated water oak, or
less commonly willow oak, of the low, stunted type indicative of a
soil of inferior productiveness. The luxuriant growth of the present
alluvial bottom is often seen within a few feet of the unthrifty
vegetation of these hammocks. It is usually only in the limestone
regions, and in the lower course of the larger streams, that the
hammocks or second bottoms are found to be of good fertility.</p>

<p><i>The Tree Growth of the First Bottoms. The Cypress.</i>—Among the
trees occupying the low ground of the first bottom in the southern
Mississippi states, the deciduous cypress (<i>Taxodium distichum</i>)
deserves special mention as an example of extreme variation in form.
In sloughs and swampy tracts, as is well known, the cypress grows with
roots submerged throughout the season, excepting only the excrescences
known as “knees,” which project above the water, probably performing
some function in connection with the aeration of the root, which is
essential to the root functions in all plants. The trunk rising from
the water is supported by numerous projecting buttresses for from
8 to 15 feet above the water; higher up it becomes cylindrical for
a height of from 40 to 70 feet, then divides up into a few widely
spreading, thick, almost conical branches, whose twigs and foliage form
an almost level surface to the head. This level-topped forest growth
characterizes at once the submerged areas of the river and coast swamps.</p>

<p>But the cypress is by no means confined to the swamps and sloughs;
it is also found occupying the better class of hammock lands, 12 or
15 feet above water level. In this case, however, the tree assumes a
shape and growth so wholly different from that described above as to
lead to a popular assertion of a difference of species. As a matter
of fact, however, the cones of these upland cypresses, when dropping
into the water below them, reproduce exactly the common swamp form. The
extraordinary difference in the aspect of the tree under these different
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</span>
conditions is best seen in the subjoined diagram, showing the upland
cypress to assume the form of the tall willow oak, with which it is
sometimes locally associated.</p>

</div>

<p>The trees from which the annexed sketch is taken grew within thirty feet
of each other, on Yellow creek, a small tributary of the Tennessee
river, in Tishomingo county, Miss. The soil stratum is underlaid by a
shaly limestone, and bears lime vegetation.</p>

<p>The fact that the deciduous cypress grows without difficulty on the
moister class of lowlands in California, 12 or 15 feet above bottom
water, is of interest in this connection. It then assumes the upland
form shown in the <a href="#FIG_81">figure above</a>, although not growing quite
as tall. The calcareous nature of these soils is probably an important factor in
this apparently incongruous adaptation of a subtropical swamp tree to
arid conditions. In its swamp form the cypress usually grows in rather
shallow, heavy clay soil, into the dense subsoil of which the roots
penetrate but little.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</span></p>

<p><i>Other Lowland Trees.</i>—The lowland hickories, like their brethren
on the highlands, seem on the whole to prefer the lighter or loamy
bottom soils to those of a heavier character. This is especially
true of the Pecan. The latter, as well as the shell-bark hickory, is
especially indicative of the highest class of bottom soils. The black
walnut, while apparently also best suited in loamy soils, is also more
or less found on heavy bottom lands, provided they are sufficiently
calcareous; and the same is measurably true of the tulip or white-wood
tree. The most frequent occupants of heavy bottom lands, however, are
the black gum and sweet gum, so that “gum swamps” are usually found to
be of that character.<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>
But in the prairie region, where the bottom soils are very calcareous
and heavy, as well as in corresponding soils of the “buckshot” lands
of the great Mississippi Bottom, the chestnut-white (cow- or basket-)
oak sometimes occupies such ground almost exclusively. Among the
accompanying trees are especially the honey locust, the crab-apple,
mulberry and sweet gum, as well as ash.</p>

<p><i>General Forecasts of Soil Quality in Forest Lands.</i>—While the
oaks and pines mentioned as forming the bulk of the timber constitute
in the cotton states the <i>primà facié</i> evidence, as it were, of
the general character of the land, there are numerous other trees and
plants which serve the discriminating land-seeker as a guide for
the quality of the soils in different localities. While everywhere,
well-developed black, red, Spanish and white oaks are considered as
signs of a high quality of land, the tall, thin scarlet, the upland
willow, and the barrens scrub oak are considered as indications
detracting materially from the producing value wherever they prevail.
The various hickories are throughout considered as indicating good
land when mixed with the oaks, or by themselves; while the presence
of walnut, linden and tulip tree will usually raise the estimate of
uplands to the highest class. On the other hand, the occurrence of
small black-gum trees and short-leaved pine, with low huckleberry,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</span>
among the oaks of whatever kind, accompanied as they usually are by the
disappearance of the black, white and Spanish oaks, will materially
depress the land-values.</p>

<p>The appearance of well-formed oaks, as well as of hickory, is therefore
at once welcomed as an evidence of soil improvement, while that of
low huckleberry bushes and small black gums indicates the reverse. An
increase in the thickness and retentiveness of the soil stratum is
also usually indicated by the occurrence of short-leaved pine in the
long-leaf-pine areas.</p>

<p>The black, red, white, and Spanish oaks belong altogether to soils of
medium physical constitution, only their <i>size</i> upon such lands
depending upon the relative richness in plant-food; but without such
changes producing any notable variation in their <i>form</i>. Clearly
then, these species are intolerant of extreme physical conditions,
and are practically restricted to soils of “loamy” character and easy
cultivation.</p>

<span class="h_subtitle">RECOGNITION OF THE CHARACTER OF SOILS<br>
FROM THEIR NATIVE VEGETATION.<br>UNITED STATES AT LARGE.<br>EUROPE.</span></h3>
</div>

<p>The application of the above data outside of Mississippi can mostly be
verified only in a fragmentary way from such data as are casually given
in the reports of State Surveys, as well as from such observations as
the writer has been able to make personally elsewhere. In the latter
category the most copious refer to the states of Alabama, Louisiana and
Illinois.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alabama.</span>—The observations of Prof. Eugene
A. Smith, and those of Dr. Chas. Mohr, are especially valuable and
cogent as to the close correspondence of the soil and vegetative
phenomena with those observed in Mississippi.<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>
They are faithfully reproduced on the corresponding geological areas,
including also the Flatwoods. Northwest of Mobile, on the Mississippi
line, the long-leaf-pine forest is interspersed with more or less
continuous areas bearing a fine oak growth, with hickories and other
trees indicating a calcareous soil. This feature is most extensively
developed in Alabama in what is known as the “lime-sink region,” on
the borders of which the vegetative transition in passing from the
non-calcareous sandy pine land, can be observed in the most striking
manner and with frequent alternations. Northward of the long-leaf-pine
belt, the tertiary and cretaceous areas show in Alabama the same
features as in Mississippi, viz., black calcareous prairies alternating
with ridge lands, among which in the cretaceous area the Pontotoc
ridge is represented by a series of isolated knobs, popularly known
as Chunnenugga ridge, closely resembling the former in its soils and
vegetative character.</p>



<p>In northern Alabama, according to Dr. Smith, on the various stages of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</span>
the Carboniferous formation, ranging from a sandy or conglomerate
character to that of limestones of various degrees of purity, soils
contrast strikingly with each other, agreeing closely with those seen
in the neighboring part of Mississippi. Here, moreover, the contrast
between the natural vegetative character as well as cultural value
of the lands derived from the magnesian limestones (the “barrens”)
contrasts strikingly with those originating in the purer limestones, on
which the blue grass is at home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louisiana.</span>—As to Louisiana, whose geological
formations correspond closely to those of Mississippi, it may be said in
general that the vegetative phenomena coincide completely with those observed
in Mississippi. The “white-lime country” of northeastern Mississippi
is represented in Louisiana only by patches occurring here and
there on a line laid from Lake Bistineau to the coast at Petite
Anse Island. But the chief characteristics of the calcareous area,
among them especially that of the occurrence of red cedar and clumps
of crab-apple, persistently reappear. The “Central Prairie Region”
of Louisiana is quite narrow, but on it there reappear precisely
the same characteristics described in connection with that area in
Mississippi. In the long-leaf-pine region of Louisiana there occur, as
in Mississippi, some isolated patches of a calcareous character, the
largest of which is on the Bayou Anacoco in Vernon Parish, near the
western border of the State. As we emerge from the sandy lands of the
long-leaf pine area to that underlaid by the calcareous formation, we
find, first, a change to oak and short-leaved pine, then the oak forest
alone; finally, on a level black prairie of considerable extent, the
post and black-jack oak in their thick-set form, clumps of crab-apple,
red haw and honey locust, here and there a red cedar; exactly as
has already been described in connection with the prairie lands of
Mississippi. To southward of the long-leaf-pine area lies a broad belt
of level, generally treeless, sandy prairie, in part dotted with groves
of timber, but otherwise with nearly the same peculiar, small-seeded
herbaceous vegetation observed in the corresponding portion of
Mississippi. But in Louisiana there intervenes between these gray sour
lands and the shell hammocks of the immediate sea-coast with their
groves of live-oak, a belt of black calcareous prairie, increasing
in width and clayeyness towards the West, and acquiring considerable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</span>
extension in the corresponding portion of Texas. On these prairies
we again find the calciphile vegetation, including the honey locust,
clumps of crab-apple and red haw, etc., but not usually any oak growth,
except (near the sea-coast) the live oak. In the hilly country of
northern Louisiana there is reproduced substantially the vegetative
character of the “short-leaf pine and oak” uplands of Mississippi
(<a href="#FIG_77">see map on p. 490, chapter 24</a>), save in that, owing to
the occasional outcropping of the calcareous materials of the Tertiary, small
prairies with black soil are spotted about here and there. Bordering
the Mississippi Bottom there are a series of oak-upland ridges with
a brown loam soil corresponding to the fertile area in northwestern
Mississippi, with small patches of the “Cane hills” loess soils,
bearing a corresponding tree growth.<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

<p>In <i>Western Tennessee</i> the vegetative zones so distinctly shown
in the adjacent portion of Mississippi are not so strikingly outlined,
but so far as they do exist, the phenomena observed accord exactly
with those heretofore described. The same holds true of <i>Western
Kentucky</i>, as is well set forth and graphically described in the
reports of the geological surveys of that state by Dr. David Dale Owen,
and later by Dr. R. H. Loughridge.</p>

<p><i>North Central States.</i>—North of the Ohio River the materials of
the geological formations are not nearly as much varied as they are
south of the same; consequently the vegetative features are also much
more uniform. It must be remembered that from the Alleghenies nearly
to the Mississippi, the states of Ohio, Southern Michigan, Indiana and
Illinois are largely covered by drift deposits overlying the older
formations, except that along the Ohio and Mississippi rivers lies the
calcareous loam of the Loess or Bluff formation.</p>

<p>Within the states mentioned, however, not only are the older
underlying formations very generally calcareous, but calcareous sand
and gravel form a large proportion of the drift deposits, which in
most cases overlie the rocks. Hence we find from the Alleghenies to
the Mississippi a predominance of the oak forests which characterizes
calcareous soils, as in the better class of uplands in Mississippi and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</span>
Tennessee; interrupted only here and there by sandy belts or ridges
bearing inferior growth, among which, again, the black-jack and
post oaks, with short-leaved pine, are conspicuous. But in a large
portion of Illinois, as well as in Western Indiana, the oak forest
is interrupted by more or less continuous belts, and sometimes by a
wide expanse, of black prairie, generally treeless or bearing only
clumps of crab-apple and haw, and underlaid more or less directly by
the carboniferous limestones, whose disintegration has materially
contributed to the black prairie soils; which are noted for their high
and long-continued productiveness. The lower ground is characterized,
besides clumps of crab-apple and red haw, by the frequent occurrence
of the honey locust, the lead plant (<i>Amorpha fruticosa</i>), the
button-bush (<i>Cephalanthus occidentalis</i>), and among herbs by
the polar plant (<i>Silphium laciniatum</i>), the prairie burdock
(<i>S. terebinthinaceum</i>), the swamp rose-mallow (<i>Hibiscus
moscheutos</i>), the sneezewort (<i>Helenium autumnale</i>), the wild
indigo (<i>Baptisia tinctoria</i> and <i>leucophcæa</i>).</p>

<p>The black-jack and post oak are not nearly as frequently found on
the prairies of Illinois as on those of Mississippi and Alabama; but
where they occur they assume a similar habit, including the occurrence
of the dwarfed, apple-tree-shaped form on the low ridges with heavy
yellow clay soil, that sometimes intersect the prairies. The post oak,
moreover, in a form quite similar to that described as occurring on
the Flatwoods of Mississippi, forms the timber of the “post oak flats”
occasionally found between the low ridges bordering the streams, or
along the edges of the prairies. The herbaceous vegetation of these
post oak flats distinctly characterizes them as being poor in lime. In
the loamy uplands, where the calcareous ingredient is more abundant,
the open-headed form of the black-jack and post oak are also found,
interspersed with a luxuriant growth of black, red and white oak, with
more or less of hickory, which here assume a magnificent development,
much superior to that seen south of the Ohio. These yellow-loam uplands
correspond very closely in their soil-composition and agricultural
character to the brown-loam area of Mississippi and Tennessee, which
lies inland from the Loess belt. Where these uplands approach the
prairie or the outcrops of a limestone formation, there is usually
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</span>
added to the oak growth the linden, the wild cherry and the ash; the
latter two also usually appear in the bottoms of the streams and on the
slopes adjacent, together with the walnut and butternut, and in the
lowest ground the sycamore.</p>

<p>The tree growth of the Loess belt bordering the Ohio and Mississippi,
so far as climatic differences permit, agrees almost precisely with
that described in the corresponding portions of Mississippi and
Tennessee. The change from the oak and hickory growth covering the
yellow-loam uplands toward the more calcareous area is evidenced by
the appearance of large sturdy trees of sassafras, together with the
linden and sugar maple. Descending from the “bluff” toward the rich
bottom-prairie with its black, heavy soil, we at once encounter the
familiar indices of the more highly calcareous land, viz., the honey
locust, clumps of crab-apple and red haw, with hackberry, Kentucky
coffee tree and mulberry on the lower ground. In late summer and during
autumn, a tall growth of the iron weed (<i>Vernonia</i>), several
<i>Eupatoriums</i> (<i>E. perfoliatum</i> and <i>purpureum</i>, the
white and the purple boneset) and of the blue-spiked <i>Verbena</i>
are very characteristic, as are also several species of <i>Cassia</i>
(Carolina coffee, etc.,) and the swamp rose-mallow.</p>

<p><i>Upland and Lowland Vegetation in the Arid and Humid Regions.</i>—In
the humid countries there is commonly a marked difference between the
vegetation of the uplands and lowlands, arising not merely from the
difference in the moisture supply, but evidently of a specific nature.
When we discuss the characteristic plants in detail, it becomes obvious
that it is <i>lime</i> vegetation that, in most cases, forms the
characteristic differences between upland and lowland forest growth; a
natural consequence of the leaching-down of the lime from the higher
land to the lower levels. By way of counter-proof we find that when the
uplands themselves are of a calcareous nature, a part at least of the
lowland flora ascends into them. As prominent examples may be mentioned
the Tulip tree (<i>Liriodendron</i>), black walnut, ash, Kentucky
coffee tree, Hercules’ club, etc., which are lowland trees over the
greater part of their area of occurrence; but in the loess or Cane
hills bordering the Mississippi and its larger tributaries, as well as
in the limestone regions of the southwestern and western states, are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</span>
conspicuous in the uplands as well. The tall southern cane
(<i>Arundinaria macrosperma</i>), usually considered a plant of the
low river bottoms, originally covered the loess or “Cane hills” of the
lower Mississippi, with their highly calcareous soils. The same is true
of many other trees and shrubs characterizing limy lands. Of course
there are some whose habitat is dependent upon the concurrent presence
of <i>both</i> lime and moisture, such as the sycamore, cottonwood,
hackberry, pawpaw, etc., which are naturally found only in stream
bottoms or on low hammocks.</p>

<p>In the arid region, on the contrary, the main difference in upland
and lowland vegetation is (outside of mountain influences) entirely
referable to moisture-conditions; the proof being that so soon as the
uplands are irrigated the lowland flora takes possession. Both uplands
and lowlands being abundantly calcareous, there then is no cause for
any material differences. This substantial uniformity of upland and
lowland plant growth is particularly striking in the comparatively
restricted floras of Eastern Oregon and Washington, and in Montana,
where the more luxuriant growth of the valleys is almost the only
contrast seen when their vegetation is compared with that of the
uplands adjacent.</p>

<p><i>Forms of Deciduous Trees in the Arid Regions.</i>—Since, as shown
above, the soils of the arid regions are almost throughout calcareous,
we should expect that the forms of the native trees would in general
conform to the rule given above. As regards the deciduous trees this
is very generally true: We rarely see on the Pacific slope, south of
Oregon, anything to compare with the tall oaks of the Atlantic forests.
The native oaks are as a rule of low, spreading growth, with stout,
short trunks; and as they rarely form dense forests, the timbered areas
have an orchard-like appearance, characteristic of the landscapes of
the arid region, from the Mezquit Plains of Texas to Eastern Oregon
and Washington. Only where a very abundant supply of moisture prevails
do we find occasional exceptions. The trees of the humid region when
transplanted to California have a perverse tendency to branch low, so
that only the most persistent trimming-up will induce them to form
trunks at all like those found in their native climes. In some cases no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_517">[Pg 517]</span>
amount of trimming will result in the formation of anything more than bushes.</p>

<p>It may be objected that the arid climate as such, and not the
calcareous nature of the soil, is the cause of this tendency. It is
unquestionable that this low-branching habit is a distinct advantage to
the plants, whose trunks would otherwise be frequently scorched by the
hot summer sun; as happens when Eastern settlers try to grow “standard”
fruit trees, with the result that a “sore,” or sunburnt streak is
formed on the southwest side of the exposed trunk. All orchard trees
should therefore be pruned “vase-shape” in arid climates, partly for
this, partly for other reasons. But this cannot explain the fact that
seedlings from eastern acorns act precisely as do acclimated trees; so
that it is not a case of the survival of the fittest to endure arid
conditions.</p>

<p><i>Tall Growths of Conifers.</i> Moreover, while the rule holds good
with almost all deciduous trees, it is not applicable to the Conifers;
which in the case of the Sequoias (redwoods and “big-trees”), sugar
pine and others, exemplify some of the tallest growths known in the
world. The Eastern Cedar or Juniper grows tall only on sufficiently
calcareous soils, and in the Mississippi Valley states at least,
wherever it occurs is an unfailing indication of calcareous lands.
The extended occurrence of the spruce on the Allegheny Ranges,
where limestone formations prevail so largely, seems to indicate a
similar preference for calcareous lands. And this is certainly true
of the black locust, which reaches its extreme southern range in the
cretaceous hills of Northeastern Mississippi, showing the stout, stocky
form it also assumes when planted in the calcareous black-prairie lands
of Illinois.</p>

<p><i>Herbaceous Plants as Soil Indicators.</i> While herbaceous plants
are not as generally considered by land-seekers in judging of soil
fertility and character, it goes without saying that very many are
quite as characteristic as the tree vegetation, especially when
deep-rooting, so as not to indicate merely the character of a few
inches of surface soil.</p>

<p>In the Middle West of the United States especially, a large number
of the Compositæ serve as marks of high productive capacity. This is
particularly true of the larger species of the sunflower tribe, among
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</span>
which <i>Helianthus grosse-serratus</i> and <i>doronicoides</i> are
perhaps the most generally notable; while farther west, beginning
with Kansas, the “Sunflower State,” and its northern neighbor, <i>H.
annuus</i>, whether native or introduced, becomes conspicuous also.
The <i>Silphiums</i> (compass sunflowers) have nearly the same
significance, <i>S. laciniatum</i> and <i>perfoliatum</i> being
prominent on the prairies of Illinois and Indiana; but in land under
cultivation they are mostly replaced by a luxuriant growth of the
Ragweed, <i>Ambrosia trifida</i>. Various species of <i>Bidens</i>
(beggar ticks), notably the <i>B. aristata</i> and <i>cernua</i>,
accompany the true sunflowers in the lower grounds of these regions,
as do also <i>Heliopsis laevis</i>, <i>Coreopsis triperis</i> and
<i>Rudbeckia</i> (<i>Obeliscaria</i>) <i>pinnata</i>. <i>Rudbeckia
hirta</i> and <i>purpurea</i>, though also occurring on rich soils,
are not characteristic of them. The larger species of golden rods
(<i>Solidago</i>), notably <i>S. canadensis</i>, <i>rigida</i> and
<i>speciosa</i> (not ordinarily distinguished by farmers) share
substantially the distribution of the large sunflowers mentioned above.
Of the Asters, only <i>A. novæ-angliæ</i> serves as a reliable guide to
high-class lands in the Middle West,<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>
but a very copious growth of asters and solidago of various species is
always a welcome indication of land quality, and indicates soils of
good lime content, if not absolutely calcareous.</p>

<p><i>Leguminous Plants.</i>—It is generally understood that most
leguminous plants, and among them especially the clovers, indicate
rich, or rather, calcareous lands. The very large proportion of lime
contained in the ash of legumes at once creates this presumption, which
is fully confirmed by experience so far as our ordinary culture plants
of that relationship are concerned. The favoring effect of lime on
the development of bacteria, so essential to the full development of
cultivated legumes, has already been referred to. The favoring effect
of gypsum sown even in small amounts with clover and other legumes, may
probably be referable to the known action of that salt in promoting
nitrification, which in the first stages of leguminous growth is so
highly favorable to a vigorous and early start of the crop, and to a
more copious production of the nitrogen-assimilating nodules. The quick
change noted in meadows and pastures of languishing production so soon
as moderately limed, by the appearance of clover among the herbage, at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</span>
once reminds us that the Rhizobia do not flourish in acid lands.
The great prevalence of leguminous plants of all kinds in the arid
region—clovers (not fewer than twenty-three species in California
alone), Lupins, Astragalus and related genera, at once remind us of the
universal prevalence of calcareous soils in these regions, as shown
above. <i>Mutatis mutandis</i>, we find precisely the same general
facts in the arid regions of the other continents.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it must be kept in mind that not all plants of the
leguminous order are positively “calciphile.” Within the United
States, it is especially the genera <i>Desmodium</i> (<i>Meibomia</i>)
and <i>Lespedeza</i>, which are very numerously represented in the
long-leaf pine region of Mississippi, where the soils are so poor
in lime. Whether under these conditions these plants develop the
rhizobian nodules, has not, so far as the writer is aware, been
definitely observed. Certain it is that quite a number of these plants
occur on both calcareous and non-calcareous soils, and on the latter
assume a much more vigorous development than in the pine woods. But
it is evident that they, with a few others (<i>e. g.</i> <i>Galactia
mollis</i>, <i>Cassia chamæcrista</i> and <i>nictitans</i>) are
more or less <i>indifferent</i> to the lime-content of soils, and
cannot therefore be relied upon in judging the quality of lands. In
Mississippi and northern Alabama, the <i>Tephrosia virginica</i>
(“devil’s shoestring”), associated with chestnut and short-leaved
pine, is characteristic of the poorest non-calcareous lands, and bears
seeds but very scantily. It disappears so soon as calcareous lands are
approached, together with the chestnut tree.</p>

<h4>EUROPEAN OBSERVATIONS AND VIEWS ON PLANT<br>
DISTRIBUTION AND ITS CONTROLLING CAUSES.</h4>

<p>The writer has thus far presented and discussed mainly his own
observations made in the United States, without reference to the
previous and contemporaneous work on the same subject in Europe. There
arose certain discrepancies which could not well be explained without a
previous full consideration of American conditions.</p>

<p>As is well known, for nearly twenty years the accepted theory in Europe
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</span>
was that of Thurman,<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a>
which attributes the distribution of the native floras entirely to
physical conditions; thus anticipating by more than half a century the
corresponding hypothesis lately brought forward by the U. S. Bureau
of Soils. Thurmann classes plants simply as hydrophile and xerophile,
thus differing from most of our modern ecologists merely in omitting
the transition phase of “mesophytes,” which now serves as a convenient
pigeon-hole for an indefinite variety of plants.</p>

<p>While gradually many were led by their observations to doubt the
correctness of Thurmann’s exclusive physical theory, Fliche and
Grandeau<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>
were apparently the first to impair by their investigations
the confidence in the accepted view. They investigated exhaustively
the conditions under which the maritime pine and the chestnut tree,
both antagonistic to lime, would flourish, and proved that the
presence of any considerable amount of lime in the land would cause
them to languish or die, although the physical conditions so far as
ascertainable were exactly alike. It is interesting to note what were
the lime-percentages which caused these differences; viz., for the
“non-calcareous” soil and subsoil, respectively, .35 and .20%; for the
calcareous land, 3.25 and 24.04%, the latter evidently being decidedly
“marly.” The composition of the ash of these trees is very instructive,
and is therefore given in full. Alongside of the ash of the maritime
pine on the two soils is given that of the Corsican pine, a lime-loving
tree.</p>

<div class="blockquot fs_90">
<p>It is very interesting to note in these analyses the inverse ratio
in the absorption of potash and lime by the maritime pine, which seems
to be unable to defend itself against excessive absorption of lime
and thus experiences a dearth of potash which naturally interferes
with the formation of starch and chlorophyl; hence probably induces
the chlorosis so well known to occur on excessively calcareous soils.
The lime-loving Corsican pine takes up a larger total amount of ash
and more phosphoric acid, and nearly three times as much potash,
but considerably less lime than did the maritime pine on the same
calcareous soil.</p>

<p>The corresponding analyses made by Fliche and Grandeau, of the
leaves and wood of chestnut grown on the same two kinds of soils, gave
in general the same results; and they add that the smaller content of
iron absorbed by the calcifuge trees when grown on calcareous soil
point also to a deleterious influence upon the normal formation of
chlorophyl.</p>
</div>

<p>Following Fliche and Grandeau, Bonnier<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>
made corroborative tests by sowing seeds of the same plants, both
calciphile and calcifuge, upon the two kinds of soils, and noting the
differences in their mode of growth and internal structure.</p>

<h4><i>Calciphile, Calcifuge and Silicophile plants.</i></h4>

<p>The subject has been somewhat exhaustively discussed by Contejean<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>
who enumerates and has classified under the three general heads of
calciphile, calcifuge and indifferent, over 1700 species of European
plants. Unfortunately he had but few soil analyses at his disposal,
and was inclined to consider as non-calcareous, most soils that gave
no effervescence with acids. But notwithstanding this disadvantage so
far as his contention of the efficacy of chemical soil-composition,
and especially of lime is concerned, he disproves very effectually
the physical theory of Thurmann, by numerous examples from France and
elsewhere in Europe; and also disposes very definitely of the claim
that there is a special class of “silicophile” plants. He concludes
that silica (and sand) is merely a neutral and inert medium which
offers refuge to the plants “expelled” by lime; and that clay similarly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_522">[Pg 522]</span>
exerts no chemical but only a purely physical action. That potash,
phosphoric acid and nitrogen, while most essential as plant-foods,
exert otherwise little if any effect on general plant distribution.
He alludes similarly to magnesia; and his final conclusion is that
“chemical are in general more potent than physical influences,” and
that the most widely active influences are carbonate of lime and
chlorid of sodium. He does not, of course, deny the potent influence of
moisture upon plant distribution.</p>

<p>Since these publications were made, many observers have investigated
the subject, and the broad distinction between lime-loving
or calciphile and lime-repelled or calcifuge plants has been
very generally recognized and discussed: but the cause of this
discrimination by plants is still more or less the subject of
controversy. Some still claim that the calcifuge plants (such as the
chestnut, the huckleberries and whortle-berries, the heather and many
other Ericaceæ, most sedges, etc.) are repelled by calcareous lands
because they need a large supply of silica, which they suppose cannot
well be assimilated in presence of much lime; hence they also designate
the calcifuge plants as “silicophile”; while others attribute the
preference of calciphile plants to the physical effects produced upon
the soil by lime, as outlined above (<a href="#Page_379">chapter 20, page 379</a>).</p>

<p>The contention that the presence of much lime in soils renders silica
insoluble and hence unassimilable by plants, is at once negatived
by the fact that waters exceptionally rich in silica, partly simply
dissolved by carbonic acid, partly in the form of water-soluble
alkali-silicates, are very abundantly found in the arid region. This
is especially the case in California, where moreover a number of
species of very rough-surfaced horsetail rushes and grasses prove the
ready absorption of silica when wanted, even in strongly calcareous
soils. But the question is whether the supposed class of silicophile
plants is a reality or merely a theoretical fiction, based upon the
habit of speaking of “siliceous” soils as a class apart from other and
especially heavier or clay soils. As a matter of fact, the siliceous
soils usually so called are simply those poor in clay and lime—in
other words, “light” lands, the outcome of the weathering of quartzose
rocks into sandy soils, which in the humid region are always poor in
lime because thoroughly leached. In the arid region, on the contrary,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_523">[Pg 523]</span>
sandy lands are quite commonly just as calcareous as the heavier soils,
and show no “silicophile” flora.</p>

<p>According to the writer’s observations and views, it being obvious that
some plants are practically indifferent to the presence or absence
of lime in the soil except in so far as it influences favorably the
physical conditions, <i>moisture</i> must always stand first as the
condition of maximum crop production, and as a <i>conditio sine qua
non</i> of the best development of plants on all kinds of soils; its
best measure being a matter of special adaptation to each species. But
this being understood, he agrees with Contejean as to the commanding
influence of lime in determining the adaptation of soils to plants,
both cultivated and wild. At the same time, it is obvious that the
absence of the opportunity to observe <i>really</i> native vegetation,
adapted to the soils through ages, has created for European observers
difficulties which are readily solved where original native floras are
available.</p>

<p>Schimper<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>
says pointedly that observations prove that the differences
between the location of plants on calcareous and siliceous soils
are not constant, but vary from province to province; that <i>e.
g.</i>, the list of indifferent (bodensteter) plants for the Alps do
not hold good in the Dauphiné, still less between the Carpathians
and Skandinavia. According to Wahlenberg the following species are
calciphile in the Carpathians, and according to Christ indifferent in
Switzerland: <i>Dryas octopetala</i>, <i>Saxifraga oppositifolia</i>,
most of the leguminous species, <i>Gentiana nivalis</i>, <i>G.
tenella</i>, <i>G. verna</i>, <i>Erica carnea</i>, <i>Chamæorchis
alpina</i>, <i>Carex capillaris</i>. <i>Geum reptans</i> is reported
by Bonnier to be exclusively calciphile on Mont Blanc, exclusively
silicophile in the Dauphiné; indifferent in Switzerland. A great number
of similar contradictions are reported by others as well, and the
entire subject thus becomes rather vague; so that Schimper and others
suggest that climatic conditions may in part be responsible for these
discrepancies.</p>

<p>In all, or nearly all these cases, it is tacitly assumed that the
underlying geological formation has essentially been the source of
the soil, and that its character is determined accordingly. But this
assumption is wholly arbitrary unless confirmed by actual direct
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</span>
examination. A soil-formation overlying limestone on the slopes of a
range may be wholly derived from non-calcareous formations lying at a
higher elevation, or may have been leached of its original lime-content
by abundant rains. The feldspars constituting rocks designated as
granite, may or may not be partially or wholly of the soda-lime instead
of the potash series; the mica may or may not be partially replaced by
hornblende, in which cases the soil would be calcareous to the extent
of determining the character of the flora as calcifuge or calciphile,
without its being at all evident in the physical character of the soil,
which would still be “granitic” or “siliceous.” Such observations in
order to be critically decisive, clearly require that the observer
should be, not merely a systematic botanist, nor a mere geologist or
chemist, but all these combined. There is good reason to believe that
most or all of these supposed contradictions would disappear before a
critical physical and chemical examination of both the soils and the
rocks from which they are supposed to have been derived. Contejean
himself, in placing so many of his long catalogue of plants into the
doubtful groups, suggests many cases in which the above considerations
may explain the apparent discrepancies.</p>

<p><i>What is a calcareous soil?</i> The definition adopted for this
volume has been given in a previous chapter (<a href="#Page_367">chapter 19, page 367</a>);
viz, that <i>a soil must be considered calcareous so soon as it
naturally supports a calciphile flora</i>—the “lime vegetation”
so often referred to above and named in detail. Upon this basis
it has been seen that some (sandy) soils containing only a little
over one-tenth of one per cent of lime show all the characters and
advantages of calcareous soils; while in the case of heavy clay soils,
as has been shown, the lime-percentage must rise to over one-half
per cent to produce native lime growth. While in the United States
observations of the contrasts between calciphile and calcifuge floras
are easily made in the field, and the facts must attract the attention
of any fairly qualified observer, in Europe they would have to be
made the subject of special cultural investigation based upon soil
analysis; a procedure not yet fully accredited abroad, any more than
in the United States. In a general way it has however been recognized
by Maercker, as shown at the end of the preceding chapter. How far this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</span>
estimate was based upon American precedents, can now be only
conjectured. Certain it is that the European definition of calcareous
soils remains to the present day a wholly different one from that
stated above; and from this have arisen the greater part of the
doubts and differences of opinions among European botanists as to the
classification of plants in relation to calcareous soils. Two per cent
of lime (equivalent to nearly double the amount of carbonate) is the
prevailing European postulate for a calcareous soil. Some go so far
as to postulate effervescence with acids, requiring about 5% of the
carbonate.</p>

<p><i>Predominance of Calcareous Formations in Europe.</i>—It is not
generally recognized even among geologists how abnormally predominant
are <i>limestone</i> formations in Europe. In all works on European
agriculture we find the “lime sand” mentioned as a normal ingredient
of soils, specially provided for (or against) in the operations of
soil examination. Its presence is the rule, its absence the exception.
Soils as poor in lime as are those of the long-leaf and short-leaf
pine regions of the United States, are there very exceptional and
(like the “Haideböden” of northern Germany) have long remained almost
uncultivated. Calcareous soils being the rule in the regions of
intense culture, the ideas of both agriculturists and agricultural
chemists have in Europe, in the main, been based upon them as normal
soils; so that instead of comparing calcareous, and non-calcareous
soils properly speaking—<i>i. e.</i>, such as would not bear native
lime-vegetation—the majority of comparisons has actually been made
between soils which, in the American sense, were all or chiefly within
the calcareous class. It is characteristic of this state of things that
the injuriousness of an <i>excess</i> of lime is among the foremost
themes of European (especially French and English) agricultural
writers, as against the beneficent effects prominently assigned to lime
in America. No such popular saying as that “a lime country is a rich
country” exists in Europe; on the contrary, we constantly hear, and see
in books, the mention of “poor chalk lands,” and in France especially
the deleterious effects of excess of lime upon crops is the theme of
remark. Excess of lime in their marly lands has been the despair of
French vintners, and Viala was specially sent to America to find some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</span>
vine to serve as a grafting stock which would resist the tendency to
chlorosis which renders many of the American phylloxera-resistant
vines useless to the viticulturists of France. Viala did not find such
grapevines until he reached the cretaceous (chalk) area of Texas,
where the native vines had long ago adapted themselves to marly soils;
and these vines have solved the problem for French viticulture.</p>

<p>And England, France, Belgium and most of western Europe <i>are</i> rich
countries, largely owing to their abundant limestone formations; and
it may be questioned whether, had this been otherwise, Europe would so
long have remained the center of civilization; for starving populations
are not a good substratum for high mental culture and progress. It
may equally be asked whether the invariably calcareous character of
arid soils, as heretofore shown, has not, together with their general
high quality, been largely a determining factor in the location and
persistence of so many ancient civilizations in arid lands; as outlined
in <a href="#Page_417">chapter 21, page 417</a>. In this connection, the proper
distinction between calcareous and non-calcareous soils passes from the domain
of natural science to that of the history of human civilization.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVI.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle">THE VEGETATION OF SALINE<br> AND ALKALI LANDS.</span></h3>
</div>

<p><i>Marine Saline Lands.</i>—While the saline alluvial lands of the
sea-coast differ both in their mode of origin and in their nature
from the alkali soils or “terrestrial saline lands,” as they have
been called in Europe, their vegetation has in many respects a common
character. Not only is there much similarity, sometimes even identity,
in the kinds of plants inhabiting these lands, but their saline
ingredients induce certain changes of form and structure in plants not
properly “saline” but more or less tolerant of soluble salts, by which
the saline or alkali character of the lands may be recognized.</p>

<p>Just as in the case of lime we must distinguish between the plants
definitely repelled by a large amount of this substance in the soil
(calcifuge), while others prefer the soils in which lime is abundant
(calciphile), and still others appear to be indifferent to its presence
and are governed in their habitat by the physical conditions presented:
so in the case of saline lands the salts may attract or repel certain
plants. The latter class is much the largest; while there is also a
number of plants which are more or less indifferent to the presence
of salts, provided these be not in very great excess. Such plants
constitute the next-largest class; while those attracted by salts, and
whose welfare is conditioned upon their presence, are comparatively few
in number, and still fewer among them are of economic importance. Hence
the soluble salts have largely a negative importance for agriculture;
the question usually being how to utilize the land until the
undesirable surplus of salts can be got rid of, partially or wholly, as
the case may be; the former usually in seashore lands, the latter in
the alkali lands proper; in which a small remnant, not sufficient to
injure crop plants, is usually desirable (<a href="#Page_462">see chap. 23, p. 462</a>).</p>

<p><i>General Character of Saline Vegetation.</i>—Those familiar with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_528">[Pg 528]</span>
seashore marshes cannot fail to note the fleshiness and succulence of
the characteristic plants. This “incrassation” belongs not only to the
saline flora proper, but is acquired to a greater or less degree when
plants not ordinarily at home on saline ground are transferred to it
artificially, or by saline overflows; while at the same time the leaves
usually become smaller, and the growth more compact. Correspondingly,
when saline plants are transferred to non-saline ground, the leaves
generally become thinner and larger, and the growth more slender.
The well-known “Russian thistle” is a case in point, as is also its
close relative, the soda saltwort (<i>Salsola soda</i>); although the
latter does not often venture as far from the saline lands as does the
former (<i>Salsola kali tragus</i>), which now seems to have become a
world-wide weed, with only a shade of preference for alkali lands.</p>

<p><i>Structural and Functional Differences Caused by Saline
Solutions.</i>—It has been definitely shown by the investigations
of Schimper, Brick, Hoffmann, Lesage, Rosenberg and others, that the
peculiarities or changes of structure brought about by saline solutions
are essentially those pertaining to xerophile (drought-enduring)
vegetation; which in general tend to the diminution of evaporation
from the plant surfaces. It may be said, roughly speaking, that the
absorption of water by the roots begins to diminish so soon as the
concentration of the saline solution approaches or exceeds one-half
of one per cent; while when it rises as high as three per cent,
water-absorption by the roots ceases even in the wettest soils, and
the plant suffers from drought quite as much as from any directly
injurious effects of the salts. Different plants of course differ in
the measure of concentration which brings about these phenomena, which
vary also with the character of the soluble salts. It is stated that
injurious or useless salts like common salt act at lower concentrations
than <i>e. g.</i>, saltpeter, which is useful. The difference in
external structure are: diminution of the size of leaves, assumption of
cylindrical or spinous forms, sinking-in of the breathing pores below
the outer surface, dense hairy covering, resinous exudations, etc.
Internally we find that xerophile plants have developed on their upper
or outer leaf-surfaces instead of one, several layers of “palisade”
(long and erect, closely-packed) cells, through which transpiration is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_529">[Pg 529]</span>
extremely slow, as is also the transmission of heat. When salt-tolerant
plants are grown on saline soils, their palisade cells are relatively
lengthened.</p>

<p>Coincident with these external means for the retardation of
evaporation, the leaves of xerophiles are frequently supplied
with special water-storage cells, which supply moisture for the
physiological processes when the root supply falls short. The cactus
tribe and similar-looking plants are examples of the latter provision,
which causes even animals suffering from thirst to resort to them,
although they eschew the saline vegetation.</p>

<p><i>Absorption of the Salts.</i>—The true halophytes or exclusive
salt plants, which refuse to grow on lands not containing a large
proportions of salt, often absorb so much salt that on drying it blooms
out on their surface; they usually have, even when green, a distinctly
salty taste, and their ash is rich in chlorids, specially of sodium.
Such is the case of the samphire, common in saline marshes everywhere.
The total ash is usually very high, often varying with the salinity of
the water or soil in which they have grown. Thus the salt-content of
the ash of samphire may vary by several per cent. In other cases, as in
that of one of the Australian saltbushes investigated at the California
station, neither the ash content nor the composition of the ash varies
materially whether the plant be grown on strong alkali land, or on
uplands whose total saline content does not exceed (in four feet depth)
.015% or 2500 pounds per acre.</p>

<p>The following table gives the composition of the ash of this saltbush
alongside of that of two other prominent alkali-plants of the same
relationship, occurring, one in the San Joaquin valley of California,
in strongly saline lands, the other in the Great Basin region of the
interior, on lands strongly impregnated with carbonate of soda. All
these, it will be seen, take up very large amounts of sodium salts,
notably the chlorid; the Australian plant most so, the “greasewood” of
the Great Basin least so; a large proportion of the alkali salts being
evidently, in the latter case, contained in the form of organic salts,
which in the ash become carbonates.

It will be noted that the saltbush hay contains nearly one-fifth of
its (air-dry) weight of ash, of which nearly 40% is common salt. It
therefore has a distinctly salty taste, and is always moist to the
touch, containing-ordinarily over 15% of moisture. It is therefore much
liked by stock when fed intermixed with other hay, and thus supplies
all the salt needed by cattle. The greasewood is much less liked by
stock, and bushy samphire is wholly rejected by them. Comparing with
these fleshy plants the ash of the two grasses, the first a world-wide
“salt grass,” the other a common grass of the American arid region,
we note that not only do they contain much less soluble ash than the
saltbushes, but especially much smaller amounts of sodium salts;
proving that even when growing in company with the saltbushes on
strongly impregnated land, they can repel from absorption these to them
useless or injurious salts. But in the case of the “shad scale,” also a
“saltbush” of the Great Basin, the ash-content is remarkably low—only
about one-fifth of that of its Australian relative—and it differs
widely from the latter in having but a very low proportion of soda,
and a very high one of lime and potash, approaching in these respects
to our usual forage crops; and being also fairly rich in nitrogen, it
forms acceptable browsing when other pasture plants are scarce. It
therefore does not exert the laxative action produced by the exclusive
feeding on the more saline herbages.</p>

<p>The exceptionally high ash-content of the cactus or prickly pear, also
given in the table, arises, it will be noted, not from the soluble
salts but from the absorption of extraordinarily high proportions of
lime and magnesia. Owing probably to the latter substance, and also the
oxalate form in which lime is usually found in the cactus tribe, this
plant when used as forage is also somewhat laxative.</p>

<p>Altogether, this table offers remarkable examples of wide differences
in the kind and amount of ash ingredients absorbed by plants growing
upon similar soils and under identical climatic conditions; indicating
a selective power which no merely physical theory of soil-action in
plant growth can explain.</p>

<p><i>Injury to Plants from the Various Salts.</i>—The early observers,
especially Contejean, were predisposed from their observations of lime
on vegetation to ascribe the action of salt upon marine vegetation
to the sodium component. But the wide differences in the effects of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_532">[Pg 532]</span>
different sodium compounds, notably of common salt and Glaubers salt,
led some to the conclusion that the acidic ingredients are the chief
determining factors. Moreover, it was soon found that a single salt is
more injurious than a mixture of several, such as sea water. This also
led to the inference that the varying degree of dissociation of these
salts essentially influences the effects.</p>

<p class="blockquot fs_90">Kearney and Cameron have investigated
these relations,<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>
and have by artificial cultures in solutions of varying concentration
and composition studied the behavior of plant roots and the limits of
their endurance. They found for the several salts occurring in alkali
soils, taken separately, the following figures, in 100,000 parts of water:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs_90">
<p>It will be noted that in many respects the results given in this
table stand in marked contrast to the facts observed in alkali lands
everywhere; and therefore while interesting physiologically, are not
directly applicable to practice. Magnesium sulfate, which according
to this table is the most injurious of all, is a common ingredient of
alkali lands from Wyoming to New Mexico, as also is sodium sulfate; yet
there, as well as in the Musselshell valley in Montana, and at many
other points, it shows no specially deleterious action either upon
native or cultivated plants, and in Europe as well as in New England
the mineral kieserite is freely used as a fertilizer at many points.
That sodium sulfate should be twice as harmful as sodium chlorid or
common salt, and half as harmful as the carbonate or black alkali, is
again wholly contrary to actual experience, which as shown elsewhere
in this chapter, indicates that the majority of plants will tolerate
between three and four times as much of sodium sulfate as of common
salt; while the ratio of tolerance as against the carbonate seems
sometimes to rise as high as ten to one.</p>

<p>It is clearly evident, however, that it is the metallic or basic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_533">[Pg 533]</span>
ingredient that in the main determines the toxicity of these salts. The
universal presence of lime in some form in all alkali lands doubtless
explains the discrepancies mentioned, since lime is especially potent
in counteracting the injurious effects; thus throwing additional light
upon the importance of the lime-content of alkali soils proper, and
also upon the causes of the narrow limitations of the littoral (marine
saline) flora; inasmuch as, unlike alkali soils, marine alluvial
lands are by no means always calcareous. Cameron goes so far as to
attribute the favorable effects of gypsum upon black alkali not so
much to the conversion of the latter into neutral sulfate, as to the
effect of gypsum solution in counteracting the saline effects. This
interpretation, however, seems rather far-fetched, since there can be
no question about the double decomposition of gypsum with carbonate of
soda; or the intense injuriousness of carbonate of soda in the actual
corrosion of vegetable tissues. The corresponding protective influence
of various salts, more especially of those of lime, against the
injurious effects of pure common salt on marine animals, has already
been mentioned (<a href="#Page_380">chapter 20, page 380</a>), and later
investigations by Osterhout on marine algæ, show the same relation to hold
true for them also.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Reclamation of Marine Saline Lands for Culture.</i>—The reclamation
of sea-coast lands and marshes for agricultural use is based in general
upon the same methods as those already outlined for alkali lands in
<a href="#Page_371">chapter 20</a>; except that in this case no chemical neutralization
is possible, since common salt cannot be changed by any practically
feasible means. It must be removed by leaching, and this, in the humid
countries in which such reclamations have chiefly been made, is usually
done by the agency of rains, aided by ditching. The “polder” lands thus
reclaimed along the shores of the North Sea, from Belgium to Prussia,
are especially esteemed for their productiveness, doubtless owing to
the alluvium of the numerous rivers tributary to that sea, which is
distributed along its shores and in the numerous inlets and bays. The
tides are of course excluded by dikes provided with gates opening
outward, so as to permit of the outflow of rain- or irrigation-water
used for leaching purposes.</p>

<p>Out of reach of stream alluvium no exceptional fertility is to be
expected of seashore lands, which then commonly assume the form of
sand dunes or bars, incapable of nourishing any cultural vegetation. Of
the latter, the groups listed below as tolerant of alkali salts, may
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_534">[Pg 534]</span>
also be considered with reference to reclaimed seashore lands; the
first cereal to succeed being usually barley, the first root crop,
beets. Asparagus is also available while salt is being leached out.</p>

<h4>THE VEGETATION OF ALKALI LANDS.</h4>

<p>The general character of alkali-land vegetation is not unlike that of
saline seashore lands; some species of plants are common to both, but
the alkali lands harbor a much greater variety of plants, owing to
the differences in climates and soils as well as to the nature of the
impregnating salts. Moreover, owing to the very causes which underlie
the presence of these salts, viz, aridity, the xerophile or dry-land
character of the alkali-land flora is much more pronounced than that
of the saline seashore vegetation. In view of the very complex
conditions, the discussion of the alkali-flora is of necessity much
more complex than that of the marine group; and the data for its full
elucidation with respect to the nature of the soils and salts are as
yet very incomplete.</p>

<p>While, as shown above (<a href="#Page_371">chapter 20</a>), the adaptation or
non-adaptation of particular alkali lands to certain cultures may be determined by
sampling the soil and subjecting the leachings to chemical analysis, it
is obviously desirable that some other means, if possible available to
the farmer himself, should be found to determine the reclaimability and
adaptation of such lands for general or special cultures.</p>

<p>In alkali lands, as in others, the natural plant-growth affords
such means, both as regards the quality and quantity of the saline
ingredients. The most superficial observation shows that certain plants
indicate extremely strong alkali lands where they occupy the ground
alone; others indicate pre-eminently the presence of common salt;
the presence or absence of still others form definite or probable
indications of reclaimability or non-reclaimability. Many such
characteristic plants are well known to and readily recognized by the
farmers of the alkali districts. “Alkali weeds” are commonly spoken of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_535">[Pg 535]</span>
almost everywhere; but the meaning of this term—<i>i. e.</i>, the kind
of plant designated thereby—varies materially from place to place,
according to climate as well as the quality of the soil. It is obvious
that if these characteristic plants were definitely observed, described
and named, while also ascertaining the amount and kind of alkali they
indicate as existing in the land, lists could be formed for the several
regions, which would indicate, in a manner intelligible to the farmer
himself, the kind and degree of impregnation with which he would have
to deal in the reclamation work; thus enabling him to go to work on the
basis of his own judgment, without previous chemical examination.</p>

<p>A study of the lands of California having this purpose in view, was
undertaken in the years 1898 and 1899 by the California Station; but
lack of funds prevented its prosecution beyond the ascertainment
of those plants the abundant occurrence of which prove the land
to be irreclaimable without the use of the universal remedy, viz,
underdrainage, which on the large scale is usually beyond the means
of the land-seeker. The botanical field work and collection of soil
samples was carried out by Mr. Jos. Burtt Davy; the chemical work,
as heretofore, being done by Dr. R. H. Loughridge. The results here
reported are therefore essentially their joint work. It is hoped that
in the future, a more comprehensive study and close comparison of
the native vegetation with the chemical determination of the quality
and kind of alkali corresponding to certain plants, or groups of
plants, naturally occurring on the land, may enable us to come to a
sufficiently close estimate of the nature and capabilities of the
latter from the native vegetation alone, or with the aid of test plants
purposely grown, for the farmers’ purposes.</p>

<p><i>Plants Indicating Irreclaimable Lands.</i>—The plants herein-after
mentioned and figured are, then, to be understood as indicating,
<i>whenever they occupy the ground as an abundant and luxuriant
growth</i>, that such land is irreclaimable for ordinary crops,
unless underdrained for the purpose of washing out surplus salts. The
occurrence merely of scattered, more or less stunted individuals of
these plants, while a sure indication of the <i>presence</i> of alkali
salts, does not necessarily show that the land is irreclaimable.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_536">[Pg 536]</span></p>

<p>The plants which may best serve as such indicators in California are
the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Tussock-grass (<i>Sporobolus airoides</i> Torr.), <a href="#FIG_82">Fig. 82</a>.</p>

<p>Bushy Samphire (<i>Allenrolfea occidentalis</i> [Wats.] Ktze.),
<a href="#FIG_83">Fig. 83</a>.</p>

<p>Dwarf Samphire (<i>Salicornia subterminalis</i> Parish, and
other species), <a href="#FIG_84">Fig. 84</a>.</p>

<p>Greasewood (<i>Sarcobatus vermiculatus</i> [Hook.] Torr.),
<a href="#FIG_86">Fig. 86</a>.</p>

<p>Alkali-heath (<i>Frankenia grandifolia campestris</i> Gray),
<a href="#FIG_87">Fig. 87</a>.</p>

<p>Cressa (<i>Cressa truxillensis</i> Choisy), <a href="#FIG_88">Fig. 88</a>,
perhaps identical with <i>C. cretica</i> auct.</p>

<p>Saltgrass (<i>Distichlis spicata</i>), <a href="#FIG_89">Fig. 89</a>.</p>
</div>

<p class="center spa2"><span class="smcap">Tussock-grass</span>
(<i>Sporobolus airoides</i>, Torr.); <a href="#FIG_82">Fig. 82</a>.</p>

<p class="center">(“Bunch grass” of New Mexico).</p>

<p>The three sets of Tussock-grass soil which have been analyzed show
that the total amount of all salts present is in no case less than
49,000 pounds per acre, to a depth of four feet; and that it sometimes
reaches the extraordinarily high figure of 499,000 pounds. Of these
amounts the neutral salts (Glauber’s salt and common salt) are usually
in the heaviest proportion (Glauber’s salt, 19,600 to 323,000 pounds
per acre; common salt, 3,500 to 172,800); the corrosive salsoda varying
from 3,000 to 44,000 pounds.—Tussock-grass apparently cannot persist
in ground which is periodically flooded. It is of special importance
because it is an acceptable forage for stock.</p>

<p>Tussock-grass is a prevalent alkali-indicator in the hot, arid portions
of the interior, from the upper San Joaquin Valley, the Mojave desert,
and southward; also through southern Nevada and Utah as far east as
Kansas and Nebraska. In the San Joaquin Valley it has not been found
farther north than the Tulare plains, although east of Reno it occurs
near Reno. Coville observes that in the Death Valley region “it is
confined principally to altitudes below 1,000 meters” (3,280 feet).
Hillman, however, reports it from near Reno, Nevada, at an altitude
which cannot be much less than 4,500 feet.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_537">[Pg 537]</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_538">[Pg 538]</span>
The tussocks formed by this grass, which are unfortunately not shown in
the figure, sometimes appear as veritable little grass trees, and when
denuded by the browsing of cattle seem like trunks 18 and 20 inches
high. It is therefore very easily recognized; but it should be noted
that in view of the extraordinary range of its tolerance, shown above,
its scattered occurrence does not necessarily indicate irreclaimable land.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Bushy samphire.</span><br>(<i>Allenrolfea occidentalis</i> [Wats.] G.
Ktze.) <span class="smcap">Fig. 83.</span>.</p>

<p>This plant is locally called greasewood, but as this name is much more
commonly used for <i>Sarcobatus vermiculatus</i>, it seems best to call
Allenrolfea “bushy samphire,” as it closely resembles the true samphire
(<i>Salicornia</i>).</p>

<p>Bushy Samphire usually grows in low sinks, in clay soil which in
winter is excessively wet, and in summer becomes a “dry bog.” Wherever
the plant grows luxuriantly the salt content is invariably high, the
total salts varying from 327,000 pounds per acre, to a depth of three
feet, to 494,520 pounds in four feet. The salts consist mainly of
Glauber’s and common salts (a maximum of about 275,000 pounds each);
salsoda varies from 2,360 to 4,800 pounds per acre. The percentage
of common salt and total salts is higher than for any other plant
investigated, and the content of Glauber’s salt is also excessive.
The areas over which this plant grows must therefore be considered
among the most hopeless of alkali lands, for although its salts are
“white,” submergence during winter precludes the growth of Australian
saltbushes. Full underdrainage alone could reclaim the soil-areas it
occupies. Bushy Samphire is common on low-lying alkali lands in the
upper San Joaquin Valley, California, and extends northward along the
eastern slopes of the Coast Range to Suisun Bay. It is also abundant in
the Death Valley region, apparently overlapping the southward range of
the <i>Sarcobatus</i>, the greasewood properly so-called.</p>

</div>

<p>The three or four species of Dwarf Samphire which grow in the interior
valleys of the State are not usually very abundant, save locally.
Wherever the species do occur, however, they may be considered as
indicating excessively saline soils. Dwarf Samphire soil has shown a
total salt content of 441,880 pounds per acre in a depth of four feet.
The neutral Glauber’s salt amounts to 314,000 pounds, almost as much as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_541">[Pg 541]</span>
in Tussock-grass soil; common salt up to 125,640 pounds while the
salsoda varies from 2,200 to 12,000. We may consider the plant as
indicative of almost the highest percentage of common salt, Glauber’s
salt and total salts. Like the preceding species it indicates land
strongly charged with salts, more especially common salt, and
susceptible to cultivation only after reclamation by underdrainage.</p>

<p><i>Salicornia subterminalis</i>, <i>S. herbacea</i> (L.), <i>S.
mucronata</i>, and another species, all occurring inland, differ
materially in habit and botanical characters from the one so
conspicuous in submerged salt marshes along the seashore; but all alike
indicate strongly saline soils, reclaimable only by thorough drainage.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saltwort</span><br>
(<i>Suaeda torreyana</i>, Wats.,<br> <i>S. suffrutescens</i>, Wats.,<br>
and perhaps one other species); <a href="#FIG_85">Fig. 85</a>.</p>

<p>Samples of saltwort soil from Bakersfield and Byron Springs,
California, taken to a depth of one foot and three feet respectively,
show that this plant grows luxuriantly in a soil containing 130,000
pounds of total salts per acre in the first foot, and with 10,480
pounds of the noxious salsoda, and 39,760 pounds of common salt in
three feet; while only a sparse growth is found on soils containing
only 3,700 pounds of salts in three feet. It thus appears to indicate
a lower percentage of salsoda than does Greasewood, but a higher
percentage than Bushy Samphire. Further investigation is necessary
to determine the exact relation of the different salts to the growth
of the plant, and as to whether carbonates occur in large quantity;
but enough data have been gathered to show that a luxuriant growth of
Suaeda torreyana indicates a soil reclaimable only by thorough-drainage.</p>

<p>Suaeda torreyana occurs on low alkali lands throughout the State of
California, from San Bernardino to Honey Lake, in the desert sinks, and
in the Great Valley, in appropriate locations. Sometimes it is replaced
by <i>S. suffrutescens</i> and perhaps other species, but all the
saltworts appear to grow in similar habitats, and it is probable that
the soil-conditions are practically the same for all these species.
They indicate land too heavily impregnated for the growth of ordinary
crops, but which will perhaps allow the Australian saltbush to succeed.

<p>This, the true <i>Greasewood</i> of the desert region east of the
Sierra Nevada, and not either of the plants known under that name in
the San Joaquin Valley and in Southern California, invariably indicates
a heavy impregnation of the land with black alkali or carbonate of
soda. Since, as before stated, black alkali is most likely to occur in
low ground, we frequently find the true greasewood forming bright green
patches in the swales, and on the benches of periodic streams, as well
as on the borders of alkali ponds or lakes. Stock unaccustomed to it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_543">[Pg 543]</span>
will frequently go to these patches on a run, only to turn away badly
disappointed after taking a few bites, the plant being both bitter and salty.</p>

</ul>

<p>Where a luxuriant growth of this plant is found, the soil may contain
from 38,000 to 117,000 pounds of total salts per acre, of which
sometimes nearly half is carbonate of soda; the content of common salt
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_544">[Pg 544]</span>
is usually low, and Glauber’s salt or sulfate of soda, sometimes with
considerable proportion of epsom salt, forms a variable proportion of
the total.</p>

<p>Greasewood is distinctly a plant of the Great Basin, only reaching
California in the adjacent counties of Lassen, Alpine, Mono, and
northern Inyo. It is very abundant on the lower levels of Honey Lake
valley, Cal.</p>

<p>The Sarcobatus is chiefly found on silty or sandy soils of good
native fertility (<a href="#Page_455">see page 445, chapter 22</a>), so that
when its excess of salsoda is neutralized by means of gypsum, the land becomes
very productive. Unfortunately the cost of the amount of gypsum required
to render such soils adapted to the tolerance of most culture plants
is often prohibitive; but where the correction of only small spots is
called for, the “white alkali” resulting from the gypsum treatment
would be tolerated by many culture plants.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Alkali-heath</span><br>
(<i>Frankenia grandifolia campestris</i> Gray);<br>Fig. 87.</p>

                  grandifolia campestris</i><br> A. Gray.</p>
</div>

<p>Alkali-heath is perhaps the most widely distributed of any of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_545">[Pg 545]</span>
California alkali plants. Its perennial, deep-rooting habit of growth,
and flexible, somewhat wiry rootstock, which enables it to persist
even in cultivated ground, render it a valuable plant as an alkali
indicator. The salt-content where Alkali-heath grows luxuriantly is
invariably high, ranging from 64,000 to 282,000 pounds per acre;
salsoda varies from 680 to 19,590 pounds; common salt ranges from 5,000
to 10,000 pounds. Such soils would not be benefited by the application
of gypsum, as the salts are already largely in the neutral state. Of
useful plants only Saltbushes and Tussock-grass are likely to flourish
in such lands, when not too wet.</p>

<p>While Alkali-heath is thus one of the most alkali-tolerant plants, it
is at the same time capable of growth with a minimum of salts (total
salts 3,700 pounds, salsoda 680 pounds). Where only a sparse growth of
this plant occurs, therefore, the land should not be condemned until a
chemical examination of the soil has been made.</p>

<p>Alkali-heath is found on soils of very varying physical texture
and degrees of moisture; while on soils of uniform texture and
moisture-conditions, but differing in chemical composition, it varies
with the varying salt-content.</p>

<p>It has been found that Australian saltbush (<i>Atriplex
semibaccata</i>) can be successfully grown on the “goose-lands,” of the
Sacramento Valley, on soil producing a medium crop of Alkali-heath; it
remains to be shown whether it will do equally well on soils producing
a dense and luxuriant growth of the same.</p>

<p>Alkali-heath is widely distributed throughout the interior valleys of
California; a closely related form grows in the salt-marshes of the sea-coast.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Cressa</span><br> (<i>Cressa cretica
truxillensis</i> Choisy);<br> Fig. 88.</p>

<p>Cressa soils show a low percentage of the noxious salsoda, but
comparatively heavy total salts (161,000 to 282,000 pounds per acre.)
Common salt varies from 5,760 to 20,840 pounds per acre in four feet.
The maximum is lower than in the case of Alkali-heath, but Cressa seems
to be much more closely restricted to strong alkali than does the
former species. Cressa appears to be as widely distributed through the
interior valleys of California as Alkali-heath. The Cressa is a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_546">[Pg 546]</span>
cosmopolitan plant, occurring, as its name indicates, on the Ionian
Islands, as well as in North Africa, Syria, and other arid countries of
the world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Saltgrass</span>, <i>Distichlis
spicata</i>.—This grass is of world-wide distribution, and always
indicates a sensible content of soluble salts, without apparently any
special preference for either of the three most commonly occurring
ones. Its maximum tolerance, as will be seen by the preceding table,
is very high, yet at the same time it will grow luxuriantly on lands
containing so little that other saline plants like the samphires,
saltwort or greasewood will refuse to grow. On the shores of Honey
Lake, California, it may often be seen incrusted with the salts of the
water concentrated by a long season of drought, yet maintaining life,
though somewhat stunted. On lands lightly impregnated, stock will often
eat it quite freely, so that it has been mistaken for Bermuda grass, to
which its habit and foliage bears some resemblance. But Bermuda grass,
while not as sensitive to alkali as most forage grasses, will probably
not bear much over 12,000 pounds per acre.</p>

           cretica truxillensis</i>,<br> Choisy.</p>
</div>

<p>The mere <i>presence</i> of the salt grass cannot therefore be taken as
a definite indication of anything more than that there is an unusual
amount of salts in the soil; whether or not there is more than will be
tolerated by the ordinary culture-plants, must be judged either from
the accompanying plants, or by experiment or analysis.

<i>Relative Tolerance of the Different Species.</i>—The following
table shows in systematic order the tolerance of the several plants
discussed above, for the different salts, so far as the data available
permit. The column marked <i>optimum</i> shows under what proportions
of salts the plants grew in about equal luxuriance, therefore under,
apparently, the most favorable conditions. Both above and below the
proportions mentioned in that column, the luxuriance (size) and
(usually) the abundance of the plants was less; showing that while
excessive amounts of salts depressed their welfare, yet they also
suffered when the proportions dropped below a certain point. Whether
this was partly or wholly the result of competition with other plants,
is an unsettled question.

<p class="center">DIRECTIONS FOR TAKING SOIL SAMPLES.<br>
ISSUED BY THE CALIFORNIA EXPERIMENT STATION.</p>

<p>In taking soil specimens for examination by the Agricultural Experiment
Station, the following directions should be carefully observed; always
bearing in mind that the examination, and especially the analysis, of
a soil is a long and tedious operation, which cannot be indefinitely
repeated.</p>

<p><i>First.</i>—Do not take samples at random from any points on the
land, but consider what are the two or three chief varieties of soil
which, <i>with their intermixtures</i>, make up the cultivable area,
and carefully sample these, each separately; then, if necessary, sample
your particular soil, noting its relation to these typical ones.</p>

<p><i>Second.</i>—As a rule, and whenever possible, take specimens
from spots that have not been cultivated, nor are otherwise likely
to have been changed from their original condition of “virgin
soils”—<i>e.g.</i>, not from ground frequently trodden over, such as
roadsides, cattle-paths, or small pastures, squirrel holes, stumps,
or even the foot of trees, or spots that have been washed by rains or
streams, so as to have experienced a notable change, and not be a fair
representative of their kind.</p>

<p><i>Third.</i>—Observe and record carefully the normal vegetation,
trees, herbs, grass, etc., of the average virgin land; avoid spots
showing unusual growth, whether in kind or in quality, as such are
likely to have received some animal manure, or other outside addition.</p>

<p><i>Fourth.</i>—Always take specimens from more than one spot judged
to be a fair representative of the soil intended to be examined, as an
additional guarantee of a fair average, and mix thoroughly the earth
<i>taken from the same depths</i>.</p>

<p><i>Fifth.</i>—After selecting a proper spot, pull up the plants
growing on it, and sweep off the surface with a broom or brush to
remove half-decayed vegetable matter not forming part of the soil
as yet. Dig or bore a vertical hole, like a post-hole, and note at
what depth a change of tint occurs. In the humid region, or in humid
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_554">[Pg 554]</span>
lowlands of the arid, this will usually happen at from six to nine
inches from the surface, and a sample taken <i>to</i> that depth will
constitute the “soil.”</p>

<p>In California and the arid region generally, very commonly no change
of tint occurs within the first foot, sometimes not for several feet;
hence, especially in sandy lands, the “soil” sample will usually be
taken to that depth, so as to represent the <i>average of the first
foot</i> from the surface down.</p>

<p><i>Samples taken merely from the surface, or from the bottom of a hole,
have no definite meaning, and will not be examined or reported upon.</i></p>

<p>Place the “soil” sample upon a cloth (jute bagging should not be used
for the purpose, as its fibres, dust, etc., become intermixed with the
soil) or paper, break it up, mix thoroughly, and put <i>at least a
quart</i> of it in a sack or package properly labeled, for examination.</p>

<p>This specimen will, ordinarily, constitute the “soil.” Should the
change of color occur at a less depth than six inches, the fact should
be noted, but the specimen taken to that depth nevertheless, since it
is the least to which rational culture can be supposed to reach.</p>

<p>In the same way take a sample of each foot separately to a depth of at
least three feet; preferably four or five, especially in the case of
alkali soils, or suspected hardpan.</p>

<p><i>Sixth.</i>—Whatever lies beneath the line of change, or below the
minimum depth of six inches, will constitute the “subsoil.” But should
the change of color occur at a greater depth than twelve inches, the
“soil” specimen should nevertheless be taken to the depth of twelve
inches only, which is the limit of ordinary tillage; then another
specimen from that depth down to the line of change, and then the
“subsoil” specimens beneath that line.</p>

<p>The depth down to which the last should be taken will depend on
circumstances. It is always necessary to know what constitutes
the foundation of a soil, down to the depth of three feet <i>at
least</i>, since the question of drainage, resistance to drought,
root-penetration, etc., will depend essentially upon the nature of the
substratum. In the arid region, where roots frequently penetrate to
depths of ten or twelve feet or even more, it is frequently necessary
to at least <i>probe</i> the land to that depth or deeper. The
specimens should be taken in other respects precisely like that of the
surface soil, <i>each to represent the average of not more than twelve
inches</i>. Those of the materials lying below the third foot from the
surface may sometimes be taken at some ditch or other easily accessible
point, and if possible should not be broken up like the other specimens.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_555">[Pg 555]</span></p>

<p>If there is <i>hardpan or heavy clay</i> present, an unbroken lump of
it should be sent, for much depends on its character.</p>

<p><i>Seventh.</i>—When in the case of cultivated lands, it is desired
to ascertain the cause of differences in the behavior or success of
a crop on different portions of the same field or soil area, do not
send only the soil which bears unsatisfactory growth, but also the one
bearing normal, good growth, for comparison. In all such cases, try to
ascertain by your own observations whether or not the fault is simply
in the subsoil or substrata; in which case a sample of surface soil
sent for examination would be of little use. In such examinations the
soil probe will be of great service, and save much digging or boring.</p>

<p><i>Eighth.</i>—Specimens of alkali or salty soils should preferably be
taken towards the end of the dry season, when the surface layers will
contain the largest amount of salts. A special sample of the first six
inches should in that case be taken separately by means of a post-hole
auger, and then, in a different spot close by, a hole four feet deep
should be bored, and <i>the earth from the entire four-foot column</i>
intimately mixed before the usual quart sample is taken. Samples of
the plants growing on the land should in all cases be included in the
package, as they indicate very closely the agricultural character of
the land.</p>

<p><i>All samples taken while the land is wet should be air-dried before
sending; in the case of alkali soils this is absolutely essential.</i></p>

<p><i>Ninth.</i>—All peculiarities of the soil and subsoil, their
behavior under tillage and cultivation in various crops, in wet and
dry seasons, their location, position, “lay,” every circumstance,
in fact, that can throw any light on their agricultural qualities
or peculiarities, should be carefully noted, and <i>the notes sent
by mail</i>. <i>Without such notes, specimens cannot ordinarily
be considered as justifying the amount of labor involved in their
examination.</i> Any fault found with the behavior of the land
in cultivation or crop-bearing should be specially mentioned and
described. The conditions governing crop-production are so complex that
even with the fullest information and the most careful work, cases are
found in which as yet the best experts will be at fault.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">SUMMARY DIRECTIONS FOR SOIL—<br>
EXAMINATION IN THE FIELD OR ON THE FARM.</p>

<p>While the general principles upon which the cultural value and
adaptations of lands should be judged, have been given in the text
of this volume, it seems advisable to summarize their practical
application to land examination here, for convenient reference.</p>

<p>The directions given in <a href="#Page_553">Appendix A</a> for the sampling
of soils having been carried out, the samples so taken may be subjected to farther
examination by any intelligent farmer to good purpose, and often with
great saving of time and expense.</p>

<p>Spread the samples from the several depths in regular order upon a
table or bench, and note the differences in color and texture apparent
to the eye or touch, and whether they will or will not crush readily
between the fingers, wet and dry. Whatever the fingers can do, can
similarly be done by the harrow, cultivator, clod crusher or roller.</p>

<p>The tilling qualities of the surface soil and immediate subsoil are the
first and most important matter to be ascertained; including especially
their behavior to water. Place some air-dried lumps in a shallow dish
with a little water; observe whether they take up the water quickly
or slowly, and whether in so doing the lumps fall to pieces or retain
their form. Slow penetration, and maintenance of form, will at once
indicate a soil somewhat refractory and difficult to till; while if
the water is taken up easily and the lump falls to pieces, the land
is easily cultivated and will absorb the rainfall and irrigation
water readily. The darkening of the tint on wetting will also give an
approximate idea of its humus-content.</p>

<p>Then take a wetted lump and work it between the fingers and on the palm
of the hand, until its “stickiness” or adhesiveness ceases to increase.
This “hand test” is of first importance and in skillful hands will
largely supersede the need of elaborate mechanical analysis. It will at
once enable the operator to classify the soil as a light or heavy loam,
clay loam or clay soil; it will show directly what will be the result
of plowing the land when wet, the liability to the formation of a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_557">[Pg 557]</span>
plowsole, and whether a single or a double team will generally be
needed to cultivate it properly. Also whether stock can be allowed to
pasture the land soon after rain. Comparison with the known land of
neighbors will also thus become easy, and in a measure the crops best
adapted to the physical qualities of the soil, subsoil and substrata,
taking into account their respective depths, will at once be at least
approximately determined. The presence of coarse and fine sand in
greater or less amounts will also be thus readily ascertained, allowing
estimates of the percolative properties; the latter can, of course,
be more practically tested in the field, in the manner described in
<a href="#Page_242">chapter 13, page 242</a>.</p>

<p>A more definite estimate of the amount and kind of sand present in the
soil materials can be obtained by washing the <i>kneaded</i> sample
into a tumbler, and allowing a thin stream of water to flow into
it from a faucet while gently stirring the turbid water. The clay,
together with the finest silts, will thus be carried off over the rim
of the glass, and sand of any desired degree of fineness, according
to the strength of the stream of water used, will be left behind. The
kind and amount of these sandy materials can then be estimated, or
definitely ascertained by weighing or measuring.</p>

<p>This will, generally speaking, be as far as the uninstructed farmer
can readily go; but these simple operations will give him an insight
into the nature of his soil and subsoil that will enable him to avoid a
great many costly mistakes.</p>

<p class="f90">RECOGNITION AND MEANING OF<br>
THE SEVERAL SOIL MINERALS.<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

<p>Those somewhat familiar with scientific methods and operations, and
supplied with pocket lens or microscope, can profitably go much
farther towards the definite ascertainment of the permanent cultural
value of the land, by the study of the minerals of which the sand is
composed, and which as a rule represent those from which the entire
soil has been formed; therefore indicate in a general manner its
chemical composition. Such examinations are specially feasible and
important when soils are not far removed from their parent rocks, as
in most of the arid region, and in the states north of the Ohio. In
the Southwestern states, in the coastal plain of the Gulf of Mexico,
the original soil minerals have usually been too far decomposed to
admit of definite identification. Sand is there as a rule made up of
quartz grains of many varieties, with only an occasional tourmaline and
pyroxene.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_558">[Pg 558]</span>
Among the prominent soil minerals, quartz is almost always recognizable
by its glassy luster and the irregular fracture—absence of definite
planes or facets of cleavage, causing the grains to be abraded or
rounded nearly alike in all directions. The <i>feldspars</i>, on the
contrary, always show a tendency to cleave into fragments having
definite, obviously oblique angles, which are perceptible even when
the grains are somewhat worn; because of the difference in the ease
with which wear takes place in the several directions. <i>Potash
feldspar</i>, moreover, which is the most important to be recognized
because it indicates a relatively large supply of potash in the
natural soil, is but rarely glassy in luster, but mostly dull white,
or reddish-white.—The <i>lime</i> and <i>lime-soda</i> feldspars
rarely show as definite forms, because of their tendency to form
complex crystalline aggregates (twins): and their definite recognition
requires somewhat complex (polarizing) appliances in connection with
the microscope. In such cases, however, the accompanying minerals
(hornblende, pyroxene, mica and others) often afford valuable
indications, because of their known association with soda-lime
feldspars in certain rocks.</p>

<p>An abundant occurrence of <i>hornblende</i> fragments, characterized
by their flat, tabular form, and bottle-green or black tint, indicate,
almost always a fairly good supply of lime in the soil, but leaves
the potash-supply in doubt. <i>Pyroxene</i> (distinguished by its
smooth, polished surface from the angularly-weathering, usually rusty
hornblende fragments) rarely occurs with potash feldspar; and soils
strongly charged with it are mostly poor in potash.</p>

<p><i>Mica</i> occurs in so many rocks and is of so little consequence
as a soil-ingredient from the chemical point of view, because of its
difficult decomposition, that its presence can mostly only serve to
corroborate or contradict conclusions as to the derivation of a soil
from some particular rock or region. But mica serves a good purpose in
improving the tilling qualities of soils. Its thin scales must not be
mistaken for the tabular fragments of hornblende.</p>

<p><i>Calcite</i> in its several forms is mostly easily recognized both by
its form under the microscope, and by the effervescence its granules
show when touched with an acid. This effervescence can generally be
observed on touching the wetted soil with chlorhydric acid, so soon as
the content exceeds two per cent; but something depends upon the
size of the grains, as when these are very small, the giving-off of gas
is less readily noted. To facilitate it, the wetted soil may be warmed
before touching it with the acid. The recognition of the presence of
lime carbonate in soils is so important as to justify considerable
trouble in rendering it definite. When the aid of a chemist cannot be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_559">[Pg 559]</span>
commanded, fairly definite conclusions may be drawn from the character
of the native vegetation; regarding which, detailed information may
be found in Parts III and IV of this volume. But where, as in the
arid region, this criterion is not available, since the controlling
factor there is the moisture supply, a presumption may be gained
by the application of a slip of moistened red litmus paper to the
<i>wetted</i> soil. Should the red paper be turned blue within one or
two minutes it would indicate the presence of carbonate of soda (“black
alkali”) as well as of lime carbonates: but if blued only after twenty
minutes or more, it would indicate the presence of the carbonates of
lime and magnesia. If not changed at all, the conclusion would be that
either lime carbonate is in very small supply, or that the soil is in
an acid condition. (<a href="#Page_122">See chapter 8, p. 122</a>).</p>

<p><i>Saline and Alkali Soils.</i>—The presence of an unusual or
injurious amount of <i>soluble salts</i>, as in the case of sea-coast
and alkali soils, is commonly easily ascertained in the field; where,
if the surface soil is at all seriously contaminated with soluble salts
of any kind, these may be seen on the surface during a dry season,
forming a whitish efflorescence, which in most cases is definitely
crystalline. In doubtful cases a tablespoonful of the surface soil may
be leached with water, and the first ten or fifteen drops caught in a
clean, bright silver spoon and evaporated. Or the soil may be stirred
up with about twice its bulk of water and the mixture be allowed to
clear by settling, then evaporating. A slight whitish film will almost
always remain in the spoon; but if the amount be somewhat considerable,
the presence of soluble salts is very readily recognized by pouring a
few drops of clear water on one side of the spot, and then allowing it
to flow gently over the spot to another place, where it is again slowly
evaporated. Any considerable amount of salts present will be shown both
in the diminution of the original spot, and in the soluble residue
accumulated where the water was last evaporated. Should <i>common
salt</i> be present to any considerable extent, the residue in the
silver spoon will, if the last drops be allowed to evaporate slowly,
show square or cubical crystals to the naked eye, and certainly to a
common pocket lens. The residue may also be tested with red litmus
paper for carbonate of soda, which would quickly turn it blue.</p>

<p>More detailed examination requires chemical reagents and experience,
but the above tests should be sufficient to prevent the mistaking of
mere white spots, whose humus has been destroyed by fermentation caused
by bad drainage, with true alkali caused by excess of soluble salts; a
mistake not uncommon in both the arid and humid regions.</p>

<p class="center">SHORT APPROXIMATE METHODS OF SOIL EXAMINATION<br>
USED AT THE CALIFORNIA EXPERIMENT STATION.</p>

<p class="center">BY R. H. LOUGHRIDGE.</p>

<p>The California Experiment Station has for many years given the farmers
of the State the privilege of having their soils examined to ascertain
any physical defects, deficiency in plant-food, or the presence of
alkali salts. They have quite generally taken advantage of this, and
the number of samples of soil sent in each year has been very large.</p>

<p>A complete analysis of a soil-sample requires fully 15 days; hence the
necessity of adopting some quick methods for the determination of the
main elements of fertility, viz., humus, lime, potash, and phosphoric
acid, that would at the same time give results sufficiently accurate
for practical purposes. Similarly for alkali salts in the soil; the
leaching-out and analysis of which often occupies more than a week.</p>

<p>The following methods have been adopted, which shorten the time of
examination for the plant-food of a soil to about one hour, except for
potash, which requires a much longer time. For alkali salts the time is
reduced to two days, and less if a pressure filter be used.</p>

<p><i>Humus.</i>—The Grandeau method of ammonia extraction requires the
removal of the lime and magnesia with weak hydrochloric acid, washing
out of the acid and then digestion with weak ammonia; all of which,
with a soil rich in humus, may require many days, though a number of
samples may be put through at the same time.</p>

<p>The method adopted to determine adequacy or inadequacy of the humus
(for this is all that is intended in this examination) is completed in
less than half an hour. It is based on the color of the humus-extract
and avoids the necessity of removal of the lime from the soil.</p>

<p>The soil is pulverized in a mortar with a rubber pestle, and passed
through a half-millimeter sieve. Seven grams of the fine earth is
placed in a test tube with 15 or 20 cc. of a ten per cent solution of
caustic potash and boiled for ten or fifteen seconds, then allowed to
settle. The humus is dissolved and the density of the color of the
solution is an indication of adequacy or inadequacy. A dense black,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_561">[Pg 561]</span>
non-translucent solution shows the presence of at least one per cent
of humus in the soil; a deep brown translucent color indicates about
one-half of one per cent; while a light brown color clearly shows a
deficiency in the soil, and a need of a good green-manure crop.</p>

<p><i>Lime.</i>—Two grams of fine earth is treated with a little
hydrochloric acid, boiled for a few seconds, and ammonia is added to
precipitate the iron and alumina; the whole, with the soil-residue, is
quickly thrown on a filter to separate the mass from the lime solution,
and washed. After adding ammonium chlorid the lime is precipitated with
oxalate of ammonia, and its adequacy for soil-fertility judged of by
the turbidity of the solution, or the bulk of the precipitate. Or the
latter may be filtered off, dried and weighed. We thus obtain a measure
of the carbonate and humate of lime present, by comparing it with the
precipitate obtained from a soil whose percentage of lime has been
correctly ascertained.</p>

<p><i>Potash.</i>—The determination of potash in the soils requires more
time than either of the other ingredients, and is more rarely made by
us. Our knowledge of the soils of the State of California obtained
through many analyses, gives us a clue to those localities where potash
would probably be deficient, as well as to those whose soils are
generally extremely rich in potash; the percentages reaching usually
from .5 to as much as 1.5 per cent and more.</p>

<p>For the determination, two grams of the fine earth is digested in
hydrochloric acid over a steam bath for two days, the insoluble residue
filtered off, the filtrate evaporated to dryness to render the silica
insoluble, again filtered and the iron; alumina and lime removed by
precipitation with ammonia and oxalate of ammonia and filtration. The
filtrate is then evaporated to dryness, the ammonia salts destroyed
with <i>aqua regia</i> or driven off by heat, and the alkalies changed
to chlorids. Any residue is then filtered off and platin-chlorid added
to precipitate the potash, which is separated and determined in the
usual way, either by reduction of the platinum by ignition, or by
measurement in a Plattner’s potash tube.</p>

<p><i>Phosphoric Acid.</i>—The determination of phosphoric acid is based
on the volume of the phospho-molybdate precipitate in a tube made like
a Plattner’s potash tube, but having a wider interior diameter for the
smaller portion (not greater than 3 millimeters), and a length of 50
mm. With this diameter, one mm. in height of the precipitate obtained
by our short method indicates one one-hundredth of one per cent of
phosphoric acid in the soil. The unit of measure must be obtained for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_562">[Pg 562]</span>
each tube, unless of uniform diameter, and is ascertained by
taking a soil whose phosphoric-acid percentage has been determined
gravimetrically and giving it the following quick treatment; which
must, of course, be closely followed in each soil to be examined.</p>

<p>Two grams of the fine earth is ignited in a platinum dish to destroy
the organic matter, transferred to a test-tube containing 5 cc. of
nitric acid and made to boil for only a couple of seconds, thus
preventing the solution of silicates to any material extent. It is not
allowed to stand, but a little water is immediately added and it is
quickly thrown on a small filter and washed with a little water. The
phosphoric acid is then precipitated with molybdic acid at the proper
temperature; allowing it to settle, the liquid is drawn off and the
precipitate transferred to the measuring-tube. It settles into the
small part in a short time if the latter is not too narrow, and is then
measured with a millimeter scale. This represents the percentage as
found in the soil by the gravimetric method, and serves as a guide for
other examinations, whose agreement with gravimetric determinations is
generally quite close, and quite sufficient for practical purposes.
The rapidity with which the solution is made and separated from the
soil is a matter of special importance for comparative results, or
determination of percentages; for if the acid solution be allowed to
stand for some time before filtration from the soil, silica passes into
solution also, and the volume of the molybdate precipitate is increased
by it; thus vitiating the results and adding to the time required for
the method. By this short method the practically important phosphoric
acid in the soil may be approximately determined within half an hour.</p>

<p class="f90 spa2">SHORT METHOD FOR ALKALI SALTS.</p>

<p>The old method of obtaining solutions of the salts by leaching the
soil on a filter until all of the alkali had been washed out has been
replaced by the following short one. 50 or 100 grams of the well-mixed
soil is placed in a bottle containing 200 cc. of water, shaken up
occasionally during 12 hours and allowed to settle. The solution may
then be passed through a common filter (or preferably a pressure
filter) and an aliquot part (usually 50 cc.) of the filtrate evaporated
to dryness in a platinum basin and ignited at a temperature just below
redness to destroy any organic matter that may be present. The basin
and contents are weighed and the soluble salts are dissolved in a very
little water and separated by filtration through a small filter into a
50 cc. cylinder and the alkali carbonates and chlorids determined by
titration, being calculated as sodium compounds.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_563">[Pg 563]</span></p>

<p>The material remaining on the filter and in the basin, consisting of
insoluble earth, carbonates and calcium sulfate, is gently ignited
in the basin and weighed; the difference between this and the first
weight gives approximately the <i>total soluble salts</i>, which should
substantially correspond to the titrations made.</p>

<p>The sulfates are determined by differences between these and the total
alkalies. The solution may contain some sulfate of magnesia, or calcium
and magnesium chlorids, and these are determined gravimetrically.</p>

<p>Nitrates, which may have been destroyed in the first ignition, are
determined in the original solution by the picric method. Any magnesia
rendered insoluble by the ignition may usually be accounted for as
chlorid, unless much nitrate is present which is rarely the case in
carbonated alkali. If much nitric acid was found, it should be first
assigned to magnesia.</p>

cases where no special credit is given in this volume for
investigations made or data given from the Southwestern States and the
Pacific Coast, these should be understood as work done, mostly under
the writers direction, or by himself and assistants, in connections
with the geological surveys of Mississippi and Louisiana, as well as
the Tenth Census of the United States, by Drs. Eugene A. Smith and R.
H. Loughridge; the chemical work for the Pacific Northwest, under the
auspices of the Northern Transcontinental Survey, by M. E. Jaffa and
Geo. E. Colby; that in California, at the Experiment Station, by the
latter two, Dr. R. H. Loughridge, and temporary assistants. It would be
impossible to segregate, without excessive prolixity, the credit to be
assigned to each of these participants.]</p>

The term “overplaced,” used for such soils in late memoirs of the U. S.
Geological Survey, is at least superfluous, in view of the perfectly
understood term already in general use, and does not seem to commend
itself for adoption by any special or superior fitness; nor does the
suggestion of Shaler (The Origin and Nature of Soils, 12th Rep. U. S.
Geol. Survey) to include the colluvial soils within the alluvial class,
commend itself either from a theoretical or practical point of view,
since but few useful generalizations can apply to both classes.</p>

Owing to the universal presence of water (H₂O) in air as well as in

The increase of solvent power on feldspar when carbonated instead
of distilled water is used, was well exemplified in an experiment
made by Headden (Bull. 65, Color. Exp’t Sta., p. 29), who allowed
pure distilled and carbonated water respectively to act on fresh but
finely pulverized feldspar, with frequent shaking, for five days. The
distilled water dissolved .0081 gram, the carbonated water, .0723 gram
of solids, or nearly nine times as much as the distilled water. Both
residues gave strong reactions for potash with platinic chlorid.</p>

The correctness of Letheby’s analyses has been disputed, partly because
of their disagreement with former analyses in the very high amount of
lime, partly because of the high potash-content in the Low-Nile water.
The lime content is, however, confirmed by the partial analyses made
by Mathey in 1887, which gives an average of 44.1 for the year, while
the older analyses, made in Europe, of <i>transported</i> water gave
only half as much. Letheby working on the spot was doubtless more
nearly right in this respect. His figure for potash in the “Low-Nile”
water agrees with former determinations, but that in the “High-Nile” is
approached only by that in the Dwina water. It may be suspected that
the soda is too low and potash too high in this analysis.</p>

This term was first employed by Th. Schloesing, in communications to
the French Academy of Sciences, and reported in the Comptes Rendus of
that body; first in 1870. Unaware of Schloesing’s work, the writer
began a full investigation of the subject of mechanical soil analysis
in 1871, and published the results in 1873 (Am. Jour. Sci., Oct. 1873).
Up to that time the limited resources of the library of the University
of Mississippi had not given him an opportunity to see Schloesing’s
publication. The two independent investigations, though conducted on
somewhat different lines, gave of course practically the same results,
and complement each other.</p>

It has of late been attempted to extend the meaning of this word
to the behavior of all powders when wetted with water. But the
adhesive plasticity of clay stands almost alone, in that (aside
from contraction) it preserves in drying the form into which it may
have been molded while wet, even when struck, whereas other powdery
substances similarly treated at once collapse back into the original
powder. The exclusive use of clay in modeling offers the typical
example of plasticity as generally understood. The addition of any
powdery substance, however fine, diminishes the plasticity of clay.</p>

Williams (Forsch. Agr. Phys. Vol. 18, p. 225 ff.) claims that
the diameter of the minutest clay particles is one-thousandth of
a millimeter, their form being that of scales showing continual
(Brownian) motion in water. He maintains that the plasticity of clay
is due to this minute size, and this view has gained wide acceptance
in late works on the subject. But this assumption cannot be maintained
in the face of the fact that nothing like the adhesive plasticity of
clay can be attained even by the finest powders of other substances,
least of all by those having the closest mineralogical resemblance to
kaolinite, such as graphite and talc. Above all, the most persistent
trituration with water utterly falls to restore plasticity to clay once
baked so as to expel its water of hydration, although the fineness
of the particles is thereby not only not diminished, but actually
increased, by contraction in heating. No powders however fine can
replace the functions of clay in soils, <i>viz.</i> the maintenance of
floccules, and tilth dependent thereupon; and they distinctly impair
the plasticity of clay. The fine “slickens” of quartz mills merely
render soils containing them more close and impervious, and more
difficult to flocculate. Even gelatinous masses like hydrated ferric
and aluminic oxids fail to replace clay in its adhesive functions.</p>

The word crumbs, which is generally understood as meaning a
relatively large, loose aggregate, seems preferable to the word
kernels, suggested for the same by King (Physics of the Soil, p.
110). Kernels are understood to be bodies rather more solid than the
surrounding mass, and do not convey the idea of loose aggregates. The
word “Krümelstructur” (crumb-structure), adopted by Wollny for this
phenomenon, has both fitness and priority in its favor.</p>

It should be understood that it is by no means easy to
insure full saturation in any considerable volume of air.</p>

<p>It has generally been considered sufficient to cover with water the
bottom of the space in which absorption was to occur. The writer found
that in order to insure uniform results, it was necessary to cover the
entire inner surface of the vessel with wet blotting paper, and even
then to exclude carefully all circulation of air by padding the joints
with such paper. When only the bottom of the box was covered, samples
placed at different levels above the water surface gave discordant
results. It was also observed that whenever the thickness of the soil
layer exceeded about one millimeter, a long time was required for
full saturation; during which inevitable changes of temperature would
bring about a deposition of dew on the soil, greatly exaggerating the
absorptive coefficient.</p>

<p>In the chamber used at the California station for soil saturation,
dimensions 12 × 18 × 19 inches high, the same soil was exposed on a
shelf close to the surface of the water, another midway up, a third
near the lower surface of the cover; liquid water being in the bottom
of the chamber, and the rest covered with wet blotters. It was found
that despite these precautions, the lowest soil layer absorbed in the
same time as much as ¾% more than the uppermost one.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote"><p class="no-indent">
<a id="Footnote_71" href="#FNanchor_71" class="label">[71]</a>
The partial saturation to a definite extent was effected by means of
solutions of calcium chlorid of different degrees of concentration,
according to the determinations of Wüllner (Pogg. Ann.). These
solutions were placed in a wide, flat dish, over which a layer of
soil 1 mm. in thickness was exposed, all being covered with a bell
glass lined inside with the same solution, so as to insure equal saturation.</p>

E. A. Mitscherlich (Bodenkunde für Land-und Forstwirthe, p. 156 et al.)
claims that all determinations of soil hygroscopicity thus far made are
grossly incorrect on account of the dew liable to be condensed on the
soil layer from fully saturated air, as the result of slight changes of
temperature. He therefore would have all such determination made either
in an air-vacuum, or over a 10% solution of sulfuric acid.</p>

<p>Such dew-formation, however, cannot happen to any appreciable extent
under the conditions maintained in the writer’s work, viz, absorption
within a thick-walled (two-inch) wooden box of the dimensions given
above, and sunk in the ground in a cellar in which the temperature
varies only a few tenths of a degree during 24 hours. The soil layer
of one millimeter thickness being put down in the morning, the 7 hour
absorption period falls at the time of slightly rising temperature, as
an additional precaution against dew-deposition. Mitscherlich fails,
moreover, to show that this source of error produces any wide or
serious discrepancies except under such long absorption periods as he
finds it necessary to use because of the great thickness of his soil
layers. It is doubtful whether the limits of errors in soil sampling
do not greatly exceed any of those involved in the writer’s method,
and whether such accuracy as is attempted by Mitscherlich is of any
practical significance.</p>

Simple as this operation appears to be, it is found to be by no means

Ad. Mayer (Agriculturchemie 2, p. 141) designates this minimum content

Whitney (Rep. Proceedings Ass’n Agr. Coll. &amp; Exp’t St’ns, Nov.

A striking case in point is the regular wind which in summer blows
through the “Golden Gate,” a gap in the Coast Range connecting the
Pacific Ocean directly with the great interior valley of California,
along the bays of San Francisco, San Pablo, and Suisun. The great
interior valley and adjacent mountain slopes becoming intensely
heated during the rainless summer, the ascending air is replaced by
a steady indraught from the sea, which is bordered by a belt of cold
water causing fogs along the coast. The fogs are quickly dispelled on
reaching the edge of the valley near the middle of its length; whence
steady breezes blow northward and southward, up the valleys of the
Sacramento and San Joaquin respectively. These winds, popularly often,
but erroneously, called trade-winds, are really “monsoons” similar in
their origin to those of India, which, when coming from the sea cause
rains, but when from the heated land itself are hot and dry; as in the
case of the sirocco of Italy and North Africa, the terral of Spain and
the northers of California.</p>

Whitney (Bull. 22, U. S. Bureau of Soils) claims on the basis of a
large number of (three-minute) extractions of soils made with distilled
water, that these solutions are essentially of the same composition in
all soils; that all soils contain enough plant-food to produce crops
indefinitely; and that the differences in production are due wholly
to differences in the moisture supply, which he claims is, aside
from climate, the only governing factor in plant growth. The tables
of analytical results given in Bull. 22 fail to sustain the first
contention; the second is pointedly contradicted both by practical
experience, and by thousands of cumulative culture experiments made
by scientific observers; the third fails with the second, except of
course in so far as an adequate supply of moisture is known to be
an absolute condition both of plant growth, and the utilization of
plant-food. It is moreover well known that it is not water alone, but
water impregnated more or less with humic and carbonic acids, that is
the active solvent surrounding the plant root.</p>

The investigations of King (On the Influence of Soil Management upon
the Water Soluble Salts in Soils and the Yield of Crops, Madison,
1903) show that from some soils at least, a sufficiency of plant-food
ingredients for a season’s crop may be dissolved by distilled water
alone, if the soil be repeatedly leached and dried at 110°. Whether
such a supply can be expected under field conditions, remains to be
tested.</p>

While regretting to thus “secede” from the fellowship of his
colleagues, the writer cannot but regret equally their voluntary
decision to do over again, or lightly reject, all that had been
done before in correlating soil-composition and plant-growth. He
still thinks that it is idle to expect any unification, national or
international, of methods of soil analysis based upon purely arbitrary
prescriptions, unless previously shown to be definitely correlated with
natural and cultural conditions; as is measurably the case with Dyer’s method.</p>

Looking at the details of the several states, we find that on the
arid side Washington has a relatively low figure for soluble silica,
which in the average, however, is overborne by the high figures for
California and Montana. The explanation of this fact probably lies
in the derivation of the majority of the Washington soils examined,
from lake deposits brought down gradually from the humid region at the
heads of the Columbia drainage, where sandy beds are very prevalent;
while the country rock—the basaltic eruptives—are very basic, and
moreover slow to disintegrate. In California and Montana the rocks
are infinitely varied, and the general outcome of their weathering is
plainly a predominance of complex hydrous silicates in the soils, as
compared with humid regions.</p>

That is to say, they now produce about 600 pounds, or 10 bushels
of wheat per acre, as do the Rothamstead soils after fifty years’
exhaustive cultivation. Probably both have come down to the permanent
level of production corresponding to the amount of plant-food made
currently available each year by the fallowing process in originally
very rich soils. The present product of cotton on the regur lands does
not seem to be on record; judging by the wheat product it should not be
over one hundred pounds of lint per acre.</p>

In this designation are included, in this volume, both the
normal (mono-) carbonate and the two other compounds, the bi- or
hydrocarbonate and the intermediate (so-called sesqui-) compound or
trona; all of which are commonly present simultaneously, but in utterly
indefinite relative proportions, varying from day to day and from
inch to inch of depth, inasmuch as their continued existence depends
upon the greater or less formation of carbonic acid in the soil, and
the access of air. Hence their separate quantitative determination
at any one time is of little practical interest. All naturally
occurring carbonate of soda contains, and sometimes consists of, these
“super-carbonates,” according to the greater or less exposure to air
and solar heat. They are much milder in their action on plants than the
monocarbonate, which unfortunately, in the nature of the case, always
predominates near the surface, and thus injures the root-crown.</p>

A wholly different kind of “black alkali” exists in some regions,
especially in the delta lands of the Colorado of the West and in the
Pecos and Rio Grande country in New Mexico. In these cases the dark
tint is due, not to a humic solution, but simply to moisture, which
is tenaciously retained by the chlorids of calcium and magnesium
impregnating the land, thus contrasting strongly with the gray tint of
the general dry soil.</p>

R. M. Harper, who has graphically described the vegetative features
of the coastal plain of Georgia (Contr. from the Dep. of Bot. Colum.
Univ. Nos. 192, 215, 216, 1902-05; also Bull. Torr. Bot. Club 29-32),
claims the deciduous cypress of the wet pine-barrens and ponds therein,
the vegetation of which greatly resembles that of the pine meadows
of the Mississippi sea-coast, to be a distinct species, <i>Taxodium
imbricarium</i>, the leaves of which are imbricated, instead of
two-ranked and with spreading leaflets. He supports this distinction
mainly by the differences in habit from the Louisiana swamp cypress,
and the fact that the imbricated form occurs wholly on non-calcareous
land, while the other is at home in the calcareous alluvial areas. The
imbricated form has been observed and commented on before, as a mere
ecological variation, and in the writer’s opinion this is all that
can be claimed, in view of the much greater differences in the form
of other trees, notably oaks, illustrated below, caused also by lime.
There would, <i>à fortiori</i>, be reason for claiming at least three
different species of post oak and black-jack (and two of willow oak),
which differ not only in tree form but also in the form and number
of leaf lobes, and yet can be traced into one another by innumerable
transition forms. If new species are to be established on such grounds,
it is hard to see where the variations manifestly due to environment
are to come in.</p>

It is a matter of regret to the writer that owing to the long distance
intervening and the difficulty of securing competent and sympathetic
observers for such work, it has not been possible for him to secure
photographs of the tree-forms here discussed. At the time his own
observations were made, photography was practically unavailable as yet,
and the figures given are therefore based upon sketches made at the
time, and partly upon recollection. They represent types rather than
definite individuals, which were however described when fresh in mind,
in the Report on the Agriculture and Geology of Mississippi, 1860,
pages 254 et seq.</p>

It has been already, and doubtless will be again and increasingly,
attempted to make distinct “species” of these widely different forms
of trees. But this is simply begging the question. Mere external
diagnostic marks will not avail here; it would have to be shown that
the seed of these different forms do not produce the other forms
under changed conditions. Until this has been done, the number-less
transition forms which he that runs may observe in the field, throw
upon the species-makers the onus of proof of differences of specific
value—if it be possible to define such value.</p>

Hence perhaps the vernacular name “gumbo” for heavy, adhesive clay
soils in the north central states; which may also, however, be derived
from a comparison with the “gummy” pods of the cultivated okra or gumbo plant.</p>
